B0D1XD1ZV3,RB47WOU0Q32Y5,Critical,"Apple AirPods Pro 2 Wireless Earbuds, Bluetooth Headphones, Active Noise Cancellation, Hearing Aid Feature, Transparency, Personalized Spatial Audio, High-Fidelity Sound, H2 Chip, USB-C Charging",4.6,5.0,"8,848","I've owned multiple pairs of AirPods over the years—standard, Pro, and even the Max version. Up until now, my favorite had always been the first-generation AirPods Pro. But after debating whether or not to get the second-generation AirPods Pro, I finally took the plunge, and I’m glad I did. Here’s what I’ve noticed after using them.The biggest improvement I noticed right away was the noise cancellation. I spend a lot of time in loud environments, whether it's in a workshop or just crowded spaces, and the V2’s ANC works much better at filtering out background noise. There’s also this new feature where it seems to adjust based on voices around you, something that wasn’t in the first version. It’s made a noticeable difference when I need to focus or block out distractions.In terms of sound, I wouldn’t say it’s a night-and-day difference, but the bass feels more punchy in this new version. The sound is crisper overall, but unless you’re really paying attention, the upgrade might seem subtle.One of the best things about the AirPods Pro (V2) is the improvement in battery life. I’m getting almost double the usage time compared to the first-gen. Plus, Apple finally switched to USB-C charging, which feels long overdue. The wireless charging has also been more reliable—no more overheating or endless charging cycles like I had with the older model.Something I always look for in Apple products is quality, and I’m happy to report that it’s still there. These AirPods feel sturdy, and they work flawlessly with my other Apple devices. Pairing them is almost instant, and the upgraded FindMy feature has been a lifesaver. The fact that the charging case can now make a noise when lost is incredibly useful—something the previous model didn’t offer, which was a frustrating limitation.AppleCare+ remains as good as ever, and I continue to recommend it for all Apple products. This time around, they’ve made it simpler by offering an option to bundle it directly with the purchase, so you don’t have to activate it later on. It saves you the hassle, and it ensures that you're covered from day one.For me, the most crucial factor is how much I use these. I wear my AirPods a lot—whether I’m listening to music or just using them for noise cancellation during daily tasks. If you’re like me and have these in your ears for hours on end, the V2 is absolutely worth the upgrade. But if you’re not using them constantly, you might want to hold off for the next version that’s likely coming soon.In conclusion, while the second-generation AirPods Pro might not be a massive leap in sound quality for the average listener, the combination of better noise cancellation, battery life, and new features make it a solid upgrade. For regular users like me, it's definitely worth the investment, but casual users might be just fine sticking with their current pair.",https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Cancellation-Transparency-Personalized-High-Fidelity/product-reviews/B0D1XD1ZV3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1

The added ear tips make customability even better especially for small ears like mine.The Active Noise Cancellation is clearly superior to the first generation and the addition of Adaptive audio is super cool and very useful.The battery is even better than I was expecting. The AirPods charge super fast in the case, and the case charging itself is also super fast. The USB-C cord is a very nice addition especially with the new, more common, USB-C charging block. The new Apple Braided USB-C cord is also a small but nice touch.I personally do not use the ring on the side, but I imagine many people may find it useful. The addition of the Find My capabilities with both the case and the AirPods themselves is beyond helpful because I always seem to misplace them. Small bonus, every time you charge the case or the AirPods, the case sounds off a little chime to let you know that they are charging or if the battery is low.As an owner of the AirPods Max and a former owner of the AirPods Pro gen 1, I would 100% recommend this new generation. The noise cancellation is superior to the gen 1, but slightly behind the Maxes because they are in-ear instead of over-ear. If you want the maxes, I would get them, but it depends on your activities. The AirPods Pro are ideal because they are small, descrete, and light weight. You can slip them in your pocket or place just one in your ear. They are also very useful and comfortable to use while working out, as opposed to the maxes.The AirPods are quite durable too. If my first pair is any indication to this pair, then I promise you, they can take a beating. After 4 years of having the first gen AirPods Pro, I have thrown them around, dropped them hundreds of times and they often got small scratches, but only chipped once or twice after higher falls on super hard surfaces. But they worked every single time.Long story short, if you’re on the fence, get them. They are super great for travel, workouts/runs, house chores, and all activities in general.Hope you find this helpful, if you have any questions please comment them!",https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Cancellation-Transparency-Personalized-High-Fidelity/product-reviews/B0D1XD1ZV3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1

This product is the Airpods Pro ""version 2"". It took me a while to convince myself to buy these, but after testing both side-by-side I noticed a few very noticeable features.*ANC is improved. I can say this with certainty. I work hobbies that at times involve loud machinery and fellas yelling at each other. I can tell the difference in the ANC ""level"". It simply works better than before and it has this additional thing that detects vocal conversations and adapts- the V1 pros didn't have that.*Sound quality is minorly improved - I have pretty good ears, and the bass sounds a bit better with these. Unfortunately, that's about all I can say about that.*Battery and compatibility vastly improved; USB-C Charging has been long overdue. The wireless charging works better than v1 too- v1 heats up quite a bit and seems to charge endlessly using the official wireless apple charger. V2 doesn't have that issue. The batteries in the case and pods are nearly 2x better from what I am seeing so far.*Quality hasn't declined; This one is important to me. I buy apple products mainly because of their build quality and how well they operate with each other. These pair nearly effortlessly with the iPhone, and the FindMy function has VASTLY improved; Making the case able to produce a sound to locate with has been a game changer. Previously with the older Airpod Pros, if you lost them while in the case, you couldn't locate them with the find-my app because they had no way to produce a noise whilst in the case. I am so glad they improved upon this quality aspect and the Airpod's quality continues to rise without noticeable compromises.*AppleCare+: Nothing has really changed about this and that's a good thing. AppleCare+ works well, and I recommend it. I use it on all of my apple devices. I was happy to see that they made it even easier than before to get AppleCare+ bundled with the actual purchase of the airpods. Before, you had to manually activate it and that was a bit inconvienent. Plus people would forget they had AppleCare and leave their device unprotected because they didn't activate it. Glad to hear they addressed all that as well.*Lasting technology: My final point is most important to me. I could ramble on and on about this part but long story short- I use these ALL the time, and I'm not joking- around 60-75% of the time I have these in, even without music playing. If you're the type of person who uses these a lot, then going from V1 to V2 is a no-brainer. But if you do NOT use them constantly like I do, don't worry! That's probably good for you and if you're not tethered to them like I am, then you should probably wait for the newer ""v3"" ones that are coming out sometime next year.The Airpod Pro's v2 might not be an impressive upgrade for audiophiles, but for almost everyone else the extra bells & whistles make up for the marginally improved sound quality and make it worth the extra cost.",https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Cancellation-Transparency-Personalized-High-Fidelity/product-reviews/B0D1XD1ZV3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1

I started a return second day because of Bluetooth issues but received support and reset my AirPods. AirPods Pro 2 works seamlessly.ANC: Much improved  superior ANC than AirPods Pro. Sound reduction appears to be 35 decibels, which means if your environment is very loud, for example, listening to a jackhammer around 103 decibels, which can impair your hearing, the AirPods pro 2 may reduce the noise by 35 decibels.  I also own the AirPods Pro also purchased on Amazon and can attest noise canceling is great on AirPods Pro2.Connectivity: Seamless Bluetooth connectionSeal:  Apple included extra small ear tips as well as three larger sizes. Seal is nearly soundproof. Much improved over AirPods Pro.Design and Weight:  Same as AirPod Pro but very lightweight and comfortable. I fell asleep with my AirPods Pro 2 and didn't know I was wearing my AirPods. The magsafe charging case can charge wirelessly.Battery Life:  Much improved over AirPods Pro which lasted about 4.5 hours on ANC mode.  I calculated the AirPods Pro 2 to last beyond 6 hours with ANC.Features:  Fortunately I am not hearing impaired but for those who are, may appreciate AirPods Pro 2 can be used as hearing aids with a hearing test soon to come since Apple has not launched a software update.  The device has hearing protection.  It has adaptive hearing, transparency mode, conversational mode, adaptive EQ,  voice isolation, 4.5 hours talk time. It is dust, sweat, and water resistant (IP54).  It also has up to 4 hours of Lossless Audio listening time on a single charge with Apple Vision Pro. 5 minutes charging in case may provide up to an hour listening time. Mag safe case can provide up to 30 hours of listening time15 and up to 24 hours of talk time.Sound: Fairly robust.  I would have preferred richer bass, but overall a great product. If you own AirPods Pro and thinking about upgrading, you should upgrade and will be very happy.",https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Cancellation-Transparency-Personalized-High-Fidelity/product-reviews/B0D1XD1ZV3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1

All Apple all the time, the way everything works together just makes the part of my brain that demands product harmony feel good. But I have never been an earbuds guy. I’ve been a regular AirPods guy, specifically not the Pros.I didn’t like things sticking in my ear, I’d never found one that works. And stupidly, my stupid reason for trying these is because of the USB C/Magsafe charging case because I’m trying to phase out my Lightning-charging devices. Guys I am unwell, okay? But stick with me a moment here. I also liked that the case is trackable in Find My along with the pods themselves, I’ve become a big Find My guy recently so that tickles my fancy.So anyway I bought a pair of 3rd gen AirPods and they’re very good but largely the same as my old 2nds. So I figured hey, I’ll try the Pro 2s and worst case I return them.I will not be returning them.Popped em in, did the setup, and some of this is because I’ve never had good noise cancelling headphones but I was sitting 7 feet from my furnace earlier and could not hear the fan. Popped one out, hella loud fan. Back in, silence. Witchcraft, sorcery.Sound quality is fabulous, I’m listening to Mint Jams by Casiopea right now because of that Reddit meme about the guy buying a record from Japan and it sounds so great. Holy Diver by Dio kicks ass, Kickstart My Heart puts your head right in Tommy Lee’s…drum kit. You could tell me they’re not audiophile quality or whatever and I’m sure you’re right but songs I’ve heard 1000 times sound like so much more wearing these.It also comes with four different size eartips, and what I’ve discovered about myself is my problem has been with the size of them. Medium didn’t feel like they were in all the way. Small was a little better, went down to extra small and I can finally wear in-ear earbuds. Ordered two replacement sets because I can see where white eartips might get gross quickly.So anyway, buy these AirPods. Connection is seamless with your Apple devices. They work great, they look good if you like AirPods. I find them very comfortable, battery life is probably fine but I haven’t gotten that far yet.

But, there was still that feeling and doubt that made me worry that they may fall out for whatever reason.After looking for weeks to find something that would work (including some that apparently caused some of the functionality of the earbuds to not work because it covered it up), these popped up. I was hesitant b/c it seemed so new and there were so few reviews, but in the end, figured if it worked, great! If not, then that would be reflected in this review. Ultimately, I'm happy to report that they work exactly like they should, minus a single flaw that can be overlooked, if you're willing to deal with the slight inconvenience.The package arrived (thank you, Prime!) quickly, and the box looks like any box that would contain these sorts of things. I don't know, there's nothing special to report there. What's nice is that they include 3 pairs (all the same size) that fit very snugly over each earbud, and each cover does NOT...cover...the little black, whatever-they-are-they-look-like-vents.Airpod functionality is not affected as they still pause when you take them out of your ears. The stems are obviously not affected, and once they're in your ears, they do a good job of holding the Airpod in place (despite some extremely vigorous headshaking)I have only two requests for future versions of these:1. Make different size ""wing"" tips. Mine fit ok, and the tip doesn't push too hard into the ear; just enough to hold the earbud in place.2. The case doesn't close when you put the earbuds into the charging case.#1 would just be nice. As far as #2 is concerned, however, that cannot be helped. The Airpod Pros are not designed to have any add-ons as they would interfere with the case closing. I tried giving it a squeeze to close the case (very gently), but no dice. You'll just have to pop them off, but they come off so quickly and easily that it shouldn't be a problem. I'd recommend getting a case for your Airpod Pros (yes, a case for the case), and store the additional earbud tips that way.Overall, I'm very satisfied with these. I've paired these with some memory foam tips to get a better seal as well. Not necessary, but it helps. Anyway, great purchase and great item!TL;DRPros- Does not interfere with primary functionality- Keeps each earbud very secure in the ear (YMMV)- Easy to pop on and off each earbud- Comes in three pairs in case you lose any of themCons- Can't close the case with them on- Tips are only one size",https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Cancellation-Transparency-Personalized-High-Fidelity/product-reviews/B0D1XD1ZV3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1

Hard plastic just doesn’t work for my ear holes so I’ve been using Skullcandy since the wired days. However, Amazon had a great sale on these WITH same day delivery and I was feeling a little hypo, so I got them and they feel great. Not only do they fit me well, they also come with multiple sizes for different ears and, using the app(it will be a new option in your iPhone settings), can test quickly and easily to figure out which size is the right fit.In my opinion, these are pretty lightweight and often I don’t even notice that I have them in, especially combined with the immersion of Spatial Audio.Price wise, they’ve been on sale for around the same price as my last Skullcandy ear buds when the model was new, the Indy ANC, but holy cow, these AirPod pro 2 buds blow them out of the water in every way.The integration with iPhone is impressive, they can even sense when you put them in your ears so it can transfer the sound at the right time without missing anything or pause your music if you remove one.The sound upgrade for me is pretty incredible and I really like how I can listen to these for hours without feeling deafened with a compressed head after.These really have so many cool features vs other headphones I’ve had that I could easily write an essay on them, but this is already tldrIf you made it this far, my one tip is to make sure to get into the settings and turn on fixed Spatial Audio as it isn’t on by default.",https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Cancellation-Transparency-Personalized-High-Fidelity/product-reviews/B0D1XD1ZV3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1

At best, I can appreciate good audio quality, even if I don't fully understand it.  What I'll be comparing it to is the Sony WF-1000XM3, which is my only other point of comparison I have for good wireless earbuds. It came out 3 years earlier for about $20 cheaper.What it does better:-Staying in my ear. This is going to change from person to person, but the WF tended to fall out if I got too sweaty and/or was running. While I have not tested this thoroughly with the AP, it seems to be a better fit and stays in easier.-Connecting to my desktop. I was never fully certain if it was my Bluetooth chip or if it were the WF's fault that it was so difficult to connect it to my desktop and to not have it randomly cut out constantly. With the AP, I can confirm the fault lies with the WF, because the AP doesn't have that issue at all.-Lack of charging issues. Towards the end of its usage, the WF would not charge properly unless the case was tilted upwards. Not easy, considering it had a round bottom. So far, the AP don't seem to have that issue.What it does worse:-Sound quality. It's slight, but it definitely sounds worse than the WF. It was one of the first things I noticed while trying it, and future comparisons confirmed that for me. It still sounds *fine* but given the WF was made earlier and cheaper? It's a point worth making.-Noise cancellation technique. I can't say for certain which cancels noise better, because they both do a good job. But I do know that the AP does something different, because sometimes after removing the AP from my ears, I still can't hear anything properly until my ear ""pops"".-Stereo issues, aka the awful inequal volume issue between each AP. So, this is a BIG one in my opinion. I wasn't sure if I was going crazy at first, because it felt like one AP, usually the left one, would sometimes be quieter than the right. I went into my settings, and sure enough, ""Spatial Audio"". One of those great Apple features you cannot turn off. I'm still working on resolving this issue, so I'll update the review if I can find something, but from my research so far, it doesn't look like there's a proper fix for it.Conclusion: It technically does somethings better and others serviceably, but the fact is that in what should matter most for earbuds, the Air Pod Pro Gen 2 does worse than a product that came out 3 years earlier and $20 cheaper.",https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Cancellation-Transparency-Personalized-High-Fidelity/product-reviews/B0D1XD1ZV3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1

I love that I can switch seamlessly between my iPhone, iPad, Apple TV, etc… The audio sound quality is excellent, controls work flawlessly, and features like transparency and adaptive noise cancellation work well.That said, they fall short in some areas and are down right annoying in others. Bose is still the undisputed champion when it comes to noise canceling and comfort. My wife Bose earbuds are way better in both areas. These don’t fit my ears great, they tend to work their way out with any movement and require constant adjustment, even if I’m just eating or talking. No way I could workout with them. The microphone sound quality is not good. Whenever I use them for phone calls, I’m constantly asked to repeat myself and am told by the other party that they are having trouble hearing me. Lastly, any app notifications you get blast your eardrums through the earbuds, unless you silence your phone, or lower your phone ringer to a low volume.For the sale price I paid, their worth keeping, but if I had to replace them, I’d probably go with Bose for the comfort, fit, and noise cancellation.",https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Cancellation-Transparency-Personalized-High-Fidelity/product-reviews/B0D1XD1ZV3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1

Far less than what apple advertises as being around 24 hours.  The charging case seems to have a charge bleed-off problem.  I have tried every single fix suggested online, including on Apple's own support website and nothing seems to work.  I tried doing a chat with Apple's support personnel, and that was a complete waste of time.  Twice I have used up all the charge in both the case and airpods themselves and then left them sit for over 24 hrs before charging back up.  Along with resetting the airpods back to factory standards and nothing seems to work.  I compare it to buying a new car and being told it will get 24 miles per gallon and then driving it and only getting 10 mpg.  Amazon only gives people 14 days to return a product like this, and unfortunately it takes longer than that to realize this problem exists.  I only noticed it after about a month and having charged the case several times.UPDATE:I finally went to an Apple Store and the Tech tested my Airpod case and told be there was nothing wrong.  I kept insisting there was a problem, so he finally agreed to send it to a repair facility and have it inspected.  They shipped me a different charging case and now it seems to be back to normal.

I am so use to the original generation that I can't stand hearing anything. The noise cancellation on the second genertion maybe great for lower pitch or frequency noise but to me its not worth the sacrifice of the higher pitched noise that comes through.Examples of noises are bags crinkling, poor audio from a TV, outdoor noise like animals that have higher pitch noise.I wish that there was an option or a firmware update to fix this.",https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Cancellation-Transparency-Personalized-High-Fidelity/product-reviews/B0D1XD1ZV3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1

They were very heavy on my head and I’m a detailer so my neck was always sore at night and in summer I’d get very hot wearing them so I got the AirPods hearing great things about them. I do like how light weight and comfortable they are in my ears and I like the adaptive sound hearing what people say while still in noise canceling mode. They’re water resistant so definitely good for detailing in the wash bay. Very fast charging. But how easy they broke I’m not too sure if it’s worth the money to get a pair. I still use them and I will until winter then I’m going to switch back to the evos to keep my ears warm.,https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Cancellation-Transparency-Personalized-High-Fidelity/product-reviews/B0D1XD1ZV3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1

They fit perfectly, noise cancelling was almost perfect, and the sound quality was unbelievable. Unfortunately they went on sale 2 days after I purchased them and Amazon said they couldn’t price match their own products. I asked for something, anything. They couldn’t. I asked for a partial credit on my account and they still said no. My only option was to return them and buy them again at the lower price, and she started the process before I could say anything. So, I returned them and purchased another pair.The second pair had all sorts of problems. I changed the rubber piece and it ripped in half. I put the larger pieces on like I had on the first pair and they didn’t fit right. They turned and got loose every time I spoke or chewed something, and they even fell out a few times. For whatever reason, the left one hurt my ear.So I called today and asked if they could replace the rubber pieces and they said no. The only option I had was to return them again, which I don’t want to do because the price has increased again and h ok best it, do I really need to buy them for the third time?I guess so. Fingers crossed the third pair will be as good as the first. The real kicker is that Amazon said they’d refund the difference once I get the new pair. They couldn’t do that the first time???The lower star rating isn’t because Amazon is making me really work for this, it’s because the second pair has some serious screwy going on. Ripped rubber, doesn’t fit right, and slips out. I would have accepted that as the norm but I experienced the first pair for 4 days and they were amazing.

Also, the H2 feature that they talk about for automatically being able to switch volumes when a person is talking to you doesn't seem to work as advertised.

I've even splurged on Apple News, so that I can get all the latest - including video footoage - daily at my fingertips.After using for a bit, I went back and purchased one of the cases, as the screen seemed pretty exposed and vulnerable, but that may just have been my perception.

I did learn that apps don't close quite the same way that they do on an iPhone, and that if I set the IPad to sleep when not in use, the battery lasts longer.

The USB-C connection significantly improves the charging process compared to the old lightning cable. With the previous iPad, the lightning cable often caused issues when charging the device during use. There were numerous occasions when I had to stop using the iPad because the battery was nearly dead, and one time it actually died. Now, with the USB-C connection, I can simply plug it in when the battery is low, and it charges while I continue to use it without any problems. Additionally, connecting the iPad to a PC via the USB-C port is much easier, and the cost of replacing a USB-C cable is almost negligible since I have an abundance of them from purchasing other devices. A primary reason for getting a new iPad was the need for a faster device, as my old one was slowing down. The new iPad is noticeably quicker, which is a welcome improvement. Overall, I am very satisfied with the purchase. However, I do have a lingering complaint about Apple's decision to reduce the storage capacity of the device, which I find concerning. Devices should never have less storage or RAM; they always need more. I typically buy the lower-end iPad models since I use them mainly for reading and streaming. My old 5th Gen iPad had 128GB of storage, whereas this 10th Gen iPad only has 64GB.

The lights will turn off completely by cycling  the sunburst icon switch. BTW this will show up on your bluetooth pairing screen as 'X-GO'.  I would recommend using a magnifying glass or even an electron microscope to read the teeny-tiny instruction pamphlet.

While I encountered some challenges with connectivity to my Onn TV, the overall performance and quality of these speakers have left me quite satisfied. Here’s a detailed review based on my experience.Setup and ConnectivityThe initial setup of the Bluetooth speakers was straightforward and user-friendly. Connecting them to my other TV was a breeze; I simply powered on the speakers, activated Bluetooth on the TV, and they paired instantly. However, I did face issues connecting them to my Onn TV. I suspect this is due to compatibility limitations with the TV itself rather than a fault with the speakers. For anyone considering these speakers, it’s worth checking your device’s compatibility to avoid similar issues.Sound QualityOnce connected, the sound quality of these Bluetooth speakers truly impressed me. They deliver rich, clear audio that significantly enhances the viewing experience. The bass is robust without being overwhelming, providing a well-rounded sound profile that makes movies and music come alive. Whether I was watching action-packed films or listening to music, the audio clarity and depth exceeded my expectations for speakers in this price range.Design and Build QualityThe design of the speakers is sleek and modern, fitting well into any home decor. They are compact enough to not take up too much space but still powerful enough to fill a room with sound. The build quality feels solid, which gives me confidence in their durability over time.Price PointOne of the most appealing aspects of these Bluetooth speakers is their affordability. At under $10, they offer exceptional value for money compared to many other options on the market. There are certainly more expensive speakers available that boast additional features or brand prestige, but for someone looking for quality sound without breaking the bank, these speakers are an excellent choice.ConclusionIn conclusion, while I did encounter some connectivity issues with one of my TVs, the overall performance of these Bluetooth speakers has been highly satisfactory. They provide excellent sound quality, are easy to set up, and come at an unbeatable price point. With so many Bluetooth speaker options available today, finding one that balances quality and affordability can be challenging, but these speakers do just that. I would recommend them to anyone looking to enhance their audio experience at home without spending a fortune.

B0CZPHPJLN,R2GA8R9KQR841V,Critical,"Beats Solo 4 - Wireless Bluetooth On-Ear Headphones, Apple & Android Compatible, Up to 50 Hours of Battery Life - Slate Blue",4.5,3.0,"1,949","It's been a while since I last owned a pair of Beats and I thought these would be better, when in reality, it was just more of the same. The only real good thing I can say about these is that they do, in fact, have great battery life and their design is sleek, but other than that, they just weren't for me.These Beats Solo 4's do come with a carrying case along with the charging cable and an AUX cable for wired playback, which I appreciate. The headphones fold up compactly and they are easy to transport, but I do have one issue with the folding mechanism that I'll talk about later. The headphones are lightweight and small, and the design is great. The headphones are easy to adjust for your head size, and the ear pads have modest cushioning. The Bluetooth pairing is simple, and on my iPhone I was immediately prompted when they were powered on to connect them.Now, let me talk about the sound quality. Unlike the older Beats which were mostly bass focused, in my opinion, these headphones were much more neutral with a flatter EQ that I generally prefer. It makes game audio richer when listening for enemies, it makes background instruments in songs more vibrant and focused, and it just allows you to hear things more how they truly sound. Except, something went wrong with the treble or the midtones or something as they were extremely sharp sounding. Most music sounds great and it is harder to notice this sharpness unless the volume is loud, but for listening to podcasts or watching online videos- that sharpness is extremely noticeable, especially in people with softer speaking voices as they sound almost whispy with sharp ""s"" and ""t"" sounds. These sharper voices almost make it sound like people or hissing as they talk and I just couldn't get over it. Admittingly, this issue is much less noticeable when using them wirelessly with my phone where I have more direct control of the EQ, but when using them wired on my PC or through my PlayStation controller, that ability to adjust the EQ diminishes. For movies or well produced content, some of that issue is more mild, but as a huge online content consumer, who mainly uses them wired, it was just not my taste. I know some won't have this issue, and I just might be more sensitive to it, but that was my experience.Furthermore, we have to talk about my other complaints. First off, the hinge mechanism for holding the headphones is a bit dangerous if you have your hands near it when storing them, as I got my finger badly pinched a couple of times while doing just this. That may not be an issue for some, but I feel like I won't be the only person to experience that. Additionally, the comfort could be a bit better. Despite the headphones being lightweight, the clamping force on the ear cups is still very strong and after just an hour of wearing them I would begin to get migraines from the pressure. My head is fairly normal sized, and even when adjusting the headband to be looser, that experience didn't stop. The headband itself is also not that comfortable. The headband, which has a silicone-like padding, gets very thin and flattens out a lot as your body heat from your head warms it up. After a while, you will feel that the headband starts to sink a bit more into your scalp before it becomes uncomfortable. Once again, all of this is just my experience, but worth mentioning.The main thing I can say is that the battery life is actually really good. They seem to charge quickly, and I haven't had issues with leaving the charger connected which destroyed one of my older Beats Studios from years ago. The battery seems to last forever as you scroll through videos, watch movies and play mobile games before that recharge is necessary.Overall, I ultimately returned these headphones. Not because they were bad, but just because they weren't a good fit for me. The sharpness in some voices over the wired connection was hard to ignore, and the migraine inducing pain from the poor comfort also wasn't worth the subpar experience I was having. While these headphones may still be great for a lot of people, I had to share my thoughts to be as honest as possible.",https://www.amazon.com/Beats-Solo-Ear-Headphones-Compatible/product-reviews/B0CZPHPJLN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1

The headphones that I received will not automatically pair to my iPhone. My iPhone has the latest update. And my AirPods do automatically pair, so I don’t think it is a device issue. The Beats do show up on my phone as if it’s trying to automatically pair, but it looks like it won’t actually pair. After a quick google search, I have tried resetting the headphones, and turning my phone on and off. Still won’t pair. I followed the Amazon link to the manufacturer, which is Apple, and it does not list Beats as a device that they can help with. I’m having difficulty finding any technical support.

These were designed for low bass listening and do not have a good range. Evidently when studying these, I learned that they were not an upgrade to the beat solo 3's but simply a different kind of headphone for people who do not like heavy bass. I do. It's not that they don't have good clear sound, it is that they sound very flat because of the low bass response. I go to a lot of concerts and I like my music loud and proud. These are not the headphones for me. I returned them and got beat solo 3's which have a very heavy bass response. Be aware that these headphones cannot be manipulated properly even with an equalizer on your source. It will not bring up the bass enough.

I was more impressed with them than I thought, even with some of their shortcomings.Which is why I decided to give the new Solo 4s a try. For me, these simply didn't have enough for me to keep them in my collection, particularly given that I own the Studio Pros.Recently, I have become a fan of on-ear headphones (as distinct from over-ear). I own the Skullcandy Riff 2, the Sony WH-CH520, and the JBL Live 670. The Solo 4s are the only ones I've returned. And it's not because they were so offensive or horrible; they simply didn't add anything to my collection.First of all, the clamping force was inordinately tight for my head. Normally, this doesn't bother me. But these simply were too uncomfortable from the moment I put them on, and they only got worse the longer I wore them.Then there was the sound. Like I said, I own the Beats Studio Pros, and have an appreciation for what they are and what they do. Even though they don't have the ability to be EQed, which I prefer, I like them in and of themselves and enjoy the sound they provide. The Solo 4s are similar in that they are a what-you-get-is-what-you-get sound. In this case, however, I found myself wishing for an equalizer. They sounded thin and harsh, not full like the Studio Pros.When I compared them to my other Bluetooth headphones, I couldn't justify keeping them in the collection. To be fair, there was a lot to like about them: the iPhone and Android compatibility, the folding design, the carrying case, and the look/style. However, the comfort and sound were just too much of a negative for me.I can see that many people will like these a lot, and I'm glad. They fill a niche and they fill it well.

This one's on me for not checking.The only issue (a big one), is that these are EXTREMELY uncomfortable on your ears for more than a short amount of time.

B0D54JZTHY,R2FZAJ95F51WTB,Critical,Apple AirTag 4 Pack,4.7,5.0,"4,961","If you're someone who frequently misplaces keys, wallets, or other essentials, the Apple AirTag might just become your new best friend. Here's why:**Design and Build Quality:**The AirTag boasts a sleek, minimalist design that blends seamlessly with everyday items. Its compact, coin-like shape is both unobtrusive and elegant, fitting easily into wallets, under keychains, or into the tiny pockets of your backpack. The build quality feels robust, with a water and dust resistance rating that ensures durability.**Functionality:**At its core, the AirTag is all about precision finding. Paired with your iPhone, it leverages Apple's expansive Find My network to locate your items with startling accuracy. The integration with the Find My app is intuitive, providing both sound-based proximity guidance and, when within range, precise location details down to a few feet. This precision is unparalleled, especially in crowded or cluttered environments.**User Experience:**Setup is a breeze, thanks to Apple's typical user-friendly interface. A simple tap, and your AirTag is ready to go. The app not only helps find your items but also lets you customize your AirTag with a unique sound, which is a delightful touch when you're in a panic.**Privacy and Security:**Apple has done an impressive job addressing privacy concerns. Each AirTag can be assigned to an owner, and if found by another Apple device, it will only display a message to contact you, protecting your privacy. There's also an alert system for if an AirTag that doesn't belong to you is detected moving with you, which is excellent for deterring potential misuse.**Battery Life:**The AirTag's replaceable battery promises up to a year of use, which is quite commendable for such a small device. The ease of battery replacement is another plus, avoiding the hassle of frequently discarding and replacing the entire unit.**Community Features:**The power of the Find My network can't be overstated. With millions of Apple devices contributing to the network, even if your item is far from where you last saw it, there's a good chance someone can help locate it without ever knowing they did. This community aspect significantly enhances the AirTag's effectiveness.**Potential Downsides:**- While incredibly useful for Apple users, the full functionality does require an iPhone. Android users might find third-party apps, but without the same level of integration.- The range can sometimes be limited if not in a dense Apple device environment, though this is rare.**Conclusion:**The Apple AirTag isn't just a tracker; it's a peace of mind device. For anyone within the Apple ecosystem, it's an almost perfect solution for keeping track of your valuables. Its design, functionality, and the robust network it taps into make it a standout product in the crowded market of finders. If you're prone to losing things, or if you value knowing exactly where your important items are, the AirTag is well worth the investment.",https://www.amazon.com/Apple-MX542LL-A-AirTag-Pack/product-reviews/B0D54JZTHY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1

It's 6 feet from my modem.... It's not my connection...for the skipping screens. Lagging stories on the news when you ask it what's the story? Video calls... Useless.

Unknown,R2KRD5RSNZHTXE,Critical,"Amazon Echo Show 5 (3rd Gen, 2023 release) | Smart display with 2x the bass and clearer sound | Glacier White",4.4,2.0,"35,562","We had a first generation Echo Show in our kitchen which died recently so I ordered this as a replacement, not realizing how small it is.  It's about the size of a standard alarm clock, which is too small for our kitchen.  Rather than returning it, though, I decided to keep it for the bedside table, which appears to be what it was made for.  I then ordered an Echo Show 8 for the kitchen, which is a much better size for there.Anyway, having this on the nightstand is nice, because not only does it function as a clock, but I can ask it about the weather, the news, etc. in the morning.  The bluetooth speaker has very good sound for its size.  Overall, it's a great purchase.  Except...It's got a couple of really annoying flaws that severely limit its usefulness.  Ugh.  Amazon, I really hope you're listening here.  At least the first of these should be fixable with a simple software update.  The second, I'm not as sure if it's a software problem or a hardware issue, but I hope that it will at least be updated by the next model.  While I'm probably not going to return this one, I can't see myself buying another one of these (or recommending it to other people) until these issues get fixed.So, first problem... Using it as a bluetooth speaker.  I like to play music from Apple Music on my iPad, and I was hoping to use this for that.  Yes you *can* link your Apple Music account directly into the Echo Show, but that's got a couple of flaws – first, you can't browse, you have to tell Alexa what to play, and second, if you've got your own music that you've uploaded to Apple Music because it's not in the main Apple Music library (or another app entirely), there is as far as I can tell no way to access it.  So, using the Echo Show as a bluetooth speaker it is.  Except...Once you pair your iPad with Alexa, it will very loudly announce that it's connected.  ""Now connected to Matt's iPad"" it says very loudly.  If I had it connected previously and I start using my iPad after leaving it sit for a while (say, I was listening the night before and I pick up my iPad in the morning to glance at the news), even if I'm not playing audio, it will make the same announcement again (which, totally unexpected like that, gives me a good jump scare).  Disconnect the iPad and it makes a loud notification sound (for a while it was saying ""Disconnected from Matt's iPad"" but I seem to have managed to at least turn that off... I'm not even sure how).  It does the same if I connect and disconnect my phone.I don't want this.  It's super annoying.  I've tried every way that I can find to turn these bluetooth announcements off, and I can't do it.  I've searched the internet and found lots of other people complaining of the same issue, but Amazon hasn't fixed it.  Some of those have suggested turning off notifications as the solution, but I've tried that (even going as far as power cycling my Echo Show to make it reboot), and I *still* get the bluetooth announcements.  They just won't go away.So, first thing this needs before I'll give it a good rating... Amazon, please do away with these bluetooth announcements, or at least make it possible for me to disable them.  Honestly, I'd prefer not to have to completely disable notifications to do it (there's no fine grain control over notifications, it's either all on or all off, which is a problem itself), but if that's how it has to be whatever.  Just get rid of these unnecessary and annoying bluetooth announcements.Then, there's what is actually a much bigger problem, but may require a hardware update to fix... The auto-dimming.So, in theory, I like and want the auto-dimming feature.  I don't want this to be at full brightness all night while the room is dark.  In the dark it goes very dim, but that makes it readable in the dark without being annoying or a distraction from sleep.  That's good.Based on how this performs, though, I have to assume that the light sensor that controls the auto-dimming is on the front and very directionally focused.  It doesn't pick up on ambient light at all.So if I turn on the bedside lamp, which happens to be located behind the Echo Show 5 on my table?  It doesn't pick up on it, it still thinks the room is dark, and it keeps the display so dim that it's totally unreadable in the lamp light.  I use my bedside lamp a lot when I'm in the bedroom, so that is a HUGE problem.  Even if I have both the overhead light and the bedside lamp on and the screen is bright, the moment I turn the overhead light off (but leave the bedside lamp on), it goes so dark as to be unreadable.But even when I'm using the overhead light...  If I even happen to stand or sit so that I'm positioned between the overhead light and the Echo Show unit, it dims the display.  Not nearly as dim as it goes in the dark room or with the bedside lamp, but still dim enough to make it significantly harder to read.So basically, I can only read the screen easily with the room brightly lit or totally dark, with light directly pointed at the unit or no light at all.  Anywhere in between and it becomes unreadable.  Of course I could ""fix"" this problem by turning auto-dimming off entirely, but then it would be brightly lit all through the night.  Which I don't want either.  Right now the only setting for this is either on or off, no in-between, no adjusting the sensitivity, nothing.So Amazon, I don't know if this means that you need more light sensors on the unit than you currently have (maybe one facing the back of the unit as well), or if it's just a software tweak to make it more (or less?  I don't even know) sensitive, but SOMETHING needs to be done about this.  A screen that I can't read isn't useful to me.Oh, and finally, this is more minor but what is up with the white power cord on my black/""charcoal"" device?  I didn't buy a white Echo Show because I didn't want a white Echo Show.  The power cord should match the device.  Way to cheap-out, Amazon.Fix these problems and I'll feel much better about the Echo Show 5 and happily recommend it to others as a bedside device.  With these issues, though, I'm sorry, but I can't recommend it.",https://www.amazon.com/All-new-release-display-clearer-Glacier/product-reviews/B09B2QTGFY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1
Unknown,R31QY5BLN00ZRT,Critical,"Amazon Echo Show 5 (3rd Gen, 2023 release) | Smart display with 2x the bass and clearer sound | Glacier White",4.4,3.0,"35,562","After several months of ownership, I thought I would post a review. I purchased this model particularly because it was to have support for Matter over Thread. Home automation is my the main thing I use this for with Apple products and Apple Home being my system of choice as the main control. I have an Echo Show 5 in the kitchen because that is the area where you are most likely to have your hands full and need to give a voice command. I also have a program that is basically a timer where the command is ""Run Distiller"" and it turns on the distiller and after three and a-half hours turns it off. So with that as the basis, I have a couple improvements that I have come across that are needed.The first is a long time issue I have had with the both the 3rd generation and previous generation of Show 5 and that has to do with the total reliance on needing to be connected to the internet. This makes for a reliability issue for any program that has multiple steps and time passage between steps because ANY interruption of the internet causes that program to fail ... so then our distiller doesn't shut off until it is out of water and we have water all over the counter and crud on the bottom of the distiller that is not as easily cleaned out. It would be nice if when a program is initiated, that all steps are internalized in the Show and made local so programs ... once started ... never fail to complete. As a matter of fact, it would be nice if there wasn't such a total reliance on the internet. As it stands right now, if you have an internet outage, you have NO local capability with the Show and it simply turns into a rock.We have also noticed that the voice recognition is not as good as it is with Siri ... and what is odd is it seems to have gotten worse with the newer version. Since our Show device is a kitchen appliance ... it gets used as a timer frequently. At least it used to be used for that. Now it doesn't seem to respond to the attention (i.e. Alexa) command from across the room the way it used to and so we have gotten to where we use Siri more for that ... but that means the iPhone needs to be sitting on the counter instead of a pocket.The third item I guess you could say is bleeding edge for Matter. I have noticed the most recent version of Apple Home has a feature where you can select what the primary Matter Hub so I believe Apple has implemented the Matter Admin features. I don't see anything like that with the Show. In addition, I believe this feature, once properly implemented, will mean that once you set a Matter device, it will be available on all Matter platforms in your home. I believe the other issue is that Amazon is going to have to step away from the total dependence on the cloud because the ability to control a Thread based device with a Matter hub is supposed to all be local.Anyway, these issues really do need resolution in my mind so that's why I'm giving it the rating I have for now. Some of this may be able to be resolved with firmware ... but the local capability might require some additional changes to the hardware as well so for now I'm not going to hold my breath.",https://www.amazon.com/All-new-release-display-clearer-Glacier/product-reviews/B09B2QTGFY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1
Unknown,RPK218B7PBGWU,Critical,"Amazon Echo Show 5 (3rd Gen, 2023 release) | Smart display with 2x the bass and clearer sound | Glacier White",4.4,2.0,"35,562","First off, I currently use only limited Echo functions.  By far the primary is voice control lights/plus.  Next is finding out the weather and occasionally asking simple questions and conversion of measurements, and finally to play music (I have Sonos system so there is little need for music from Echo).The good-The device has a quality feel and looks good.  The fabric covering looks good (not sure not it stands up long term but I have no problem with it on my 5th Generation echo dot). But as others have said who thought it was a good idea to put a white cord on a charcoal device?? The screen has good resolution and brightness.  The volume is more than adequate. The device is good at picking up voice commands (but more on that later).In addition to the way I currently use the Echo, my needs for this were pretty basic (I thought). First off a way to control lights/outlets by touch pad rather than voice, visual display of the weather,  and reading recipes and occasional video in the kitchen or else as a bedroom clock.My first problems customizing the device.  There are way too many options that need to be turned off.  From past experience with Amazon devices I was pretty sure that I may need to go through the option setup after an O/S update.  During this process the device was very slow, it was non responsive twice for more than 2 minutes, and once locked up and I needed to unplug it (and lost some of the changes I was making).  The slow response and non responsiveness continued in all use of the device but fortunately not as bad as it was during setup, but it did lock up twice while I was using it. I rather quickly saw that a 5.5 inch screen would make much of my wish list hard to meet on a really useful basis but I thought based on the sale price I could compromise.As a way to control lights/plug there is no way to make that the default screen.  While it should have only been a quick swipe to get to the control screen the problem with slow response and locking up it quickly became a bit of an issue.  In addition, I found that if I had been using it to watch a video any swipe on the clock/Home Screen returned to the video and did not take me to the screen to select any use other than video.  I had to go through the process of going back to Home Screen and then swiping down to get to the option selection screen.  Also a problem was the 5.5 screen just did not allow the display of much of the lights/plugs without a slow scroll.  It quickly became apparent that my main use was going really fulfill what I was hoping for.For my purpose of asking weather, answering basic questions, it worked fine.  It had no problem picking up my voice.  Unfortunately the small screen size meant visual display of the weather was of no use unless you were close to the device.  However it had the same problem I have with some my other Echo devices in that the wrong Echo device sometimes responds.  This is more of an Amazon issue than device issue.  I get around this by using a different wake word for each device.  So it fulfilled this need, but so does every Echo device.I played some music.  It doesn't display much in the way of options (just most recently played) of music to play.  It is really designed to use your voice to control.  No display of playlist or anything.  I tried to add an additional Echo to play music.  It started the song at the beginning rather than at the same place as the song currently playing on the Echo Show.  It also said that two of my other Echo devices (I have 4 others) were not compatible. I could still select them and they seemed to play fine so not sure what the compatibility issue was.  I didn't pursue this from the other device or really try it much.  While the sound isn't bad but it wasn't as good as my Echo dot 5th generation.  It was tuned for too much bass, I could not change the equalizer to make the sound more than adequate.  I was expecting an improvement over the Echo Dot. So while it seemed to meets my needs, I called it a fail because of the potential issues with playing of music on multiple devices and no improvement in sound quality.At this point I realized that a 5.5 in screen just limited the device too much for most visual purposes.  Recipes and videos were too small to watch unless it was really close to you.  Using a larger tablet or even laptop became a better option.Finally the clock.  Using the adaptive lighting it was too dark to read in a dark room.  There was the constant interruption of suggested skills that were brighter than anything else and quickly became very annoying.  The one night I used it, when I looked at in the morning the screen was blank until I touched it to reactivate the device.So, even on a good sale price it just didn't do what I wanted/expected and it was returned.  For light/plug control I will use an old tablet and find a stand for it, for music and weather/questions I may get another Echo Dot (maybe the one with a clock built in).  I can use a tablet to show a list of the music that I have available and not have to use my voice.  For recipes and video in the kitchen I will continue to use a tablet or laptop.  My hope for one device that fulfill multiple wants just didn't work and the Echo Show was returned.",https://www.amazon.com/All-new-release-display-clearer-Glacier/product-reviews/B09B2QTGFY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1
Unknown,RAHXIZXWNTM6Z,Critical,"Amazon Echo Show 5 (3rd Gen, 2023 release) | Smart display with 2x the bass and clearer sound | Glacier White",4.4,3.0,"35,562","This is the first Echo Show I've set up, but I'm pretty tech savvy. Here's the pros and cons so far.Pros- Looks like a bedside clock (if you set it up that way) and is not very noticeable. I like this.- Sound seems good so far. This is why I bought this model when it was on sale. I heard the sound quality on older models wasn't as good. This one is pretty loud. I'm happy with that.- Has a slider to cover the camera if you want privacy- Has a button on top to turn off the microphone and Alexa 'Listening"" if you want (you'll see a red bar at the bottom of the screen if you do this.)- I like the Drop In feature.- I like that it also has a home monitoring feature (but it doesn't work right)- This can also supposedly sense motion and trigger alexa skills for that too, but I haven't tried that yet. I dont' believe they are true motion sensors. I believe they detect motion using the camera. If the camera is covered, there'd be no motion sensing.Cons- It's small. But I knew that. The screen is about the same size as a smartphone turned on its side.- If you're making a video call to this, and you are using a cell phone in portrait view, your image is going to be so tiny on this echo show's screen!  It'll be vertical and in the center. It won't enlarge to fill the screen. Best way to call this device will be from a tablet or or something else in horizontal view. (With a camera that is centered and not off to the side, when it's horizontal.)- ""Home Monitoring"" worked the first day, and I could not get it to work after that. I don't know why. It's frustrating and annoying. I did everything I could think of, short of calling customer support (which I'll try another day) I read that this is a common problem.- There's a lag sometimes, especially with the app I'm using on my phone, to connect to this. That makes it hard to know sometimes if you need to press a button again. Also, any time you change a setting, you might get stuck/frozen for a while, while it updates with amazon's cloud. Sometimes I had to unplug it and plug it back in, to get it out of that loop.- No battery. If this gets unplugged or power goes out, this won't work. You also can't move it around the room (because it's plugged in!) - Again, I knew this beforehand. FYI, I wanted to use a fire tablet in ""show mode"" to get around this problem, but the tablets are not loud enough. I needed a loud device for video calls. This echo show IS loud.- I wanted to make a widget with an alexa skill to make a tappable shortcut for a phonecall. I could not find a way to do this. It might be possible, but I could not find instructions for this online, and customer support could not help me with this either.- I did eneable ""Tap to Alexa"" for a while (then later disabled it). That might work ok for someone who has speech difficulty, and needs visual buttons. But if you're trying to add buttons to simplify this for a more debilitated person or someone who doesn't know a lot about tech, that won't help much. The text under the tiles is small, the icons for the tiles can only be customized with an image from the built in set - and they all look similar. There's no way to customize a tile enough to make it stand out, so someone knows ""THIS is the button you press to call me!"" You also cannot fully customize the tiles screen. Some tiles cannot be deleted or re-arranged. (others can.)- This doesn't have night vision. I knew this already. If a room is dim or dark it's hard to see the other person and that room.Mostly it's a little buggy. I'm hoping things will work better as I get more used to working with it.The lag sometimes is frustrating.Things not working that worked the day before, is frustrating.Having SO MANY SETTINGS to customize is frustrating. Most related to extras I don't want to be shown. Ads, suggestions, ""Try this!"" etc. I want this to be a clock that can make video calls. That's all I want to do with this. It is difficult to find ALL the settings you need to find, to simplify it to that. It's great that it can do so many other things, but I want this to be more simplified, and that's not easy to do.I may report back later (I may not ;) ) once I've used it more. I really like all the things about it that work. I'm a little frustrated by some of the bugginess.",https://www.amazon.com/All-new-release-display-clearer-Glacier/product-reviews/B09B2QTGFY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1

I bought it to replace an earlier version that was becoming more difficult to get to work properly.This one has become very unhelpful. It usually takes 5 attempts to get it to respond, and then it often does something totally different from the request.The automatic screen brightness adjust does not work correctly. It makes it too dim to see during the day and bright enough to light the room at night.It used to play music that was requested. For example, I could say, ""Alexa, ply music by Bob Dylan"". And it would play music by Bob Dylan for an hour or more. It does not do that any more. Now it says, ""Playing music by Bob Dylan or similar artists."" And it starts playing random stuff not related to the request. By the way, my subscriptions have not changed.Because of these problems, I now just want to use it as a smart clock - displaying time, and occasionally as an alarm clock or timer. Good luck with that!It has started displaying ads. Of course these are ads for stuff I don't want nor do I want to see. I cannot get them to stop. I have done all of the turning off notifications and ads, but they don't stop. It is not helpful when I look to see what time it is and all I see is an ad for some watch - and when I ask it what time it is I am ignored.Although it seems like a good idea, I do not recommend buying any of these devices. Maybe some day we can buy something that does what we thought we were buying.I do not want to pay to watch commercials and ads.UPDATE: Amazon called me about my review. Nice.She listened, and explained there is a recent problem causing the AD and voice recognition problems. The current work-around is changing the language to English-Canadian. It worked.I still don't know why the songs are random. I am a prime member, and the description of the Amazon Music plan says it should work the way it used to.I have changed the rating from 2 to 3 stars because Amazon tech called me and the sponsored ads are gone for now.It used to be a useful tool for me, but its still an expensive annoyance without the music working. And adding another $100+ charge is not going to happen here.UPDATE 2: I have resorted to just using this echo show 5 as an alarm clock. It even has an issue with that. The clock display constantly (semi randomly) goes dim, then off, then on, then off for 5 to 10 seconds, then full brightness, and then it starts all over again.Researching this, I found that I am to go to settings, then home, then some other home setting - scroll to the bottom and turn off ""rotate continuously"". It's already off. I tried turning it on. No difference. Off again. No difference. It is tough to try to sleep in the room with random flashes that light up the room.There are some very good alarm clocks available for much less cost. I wanted one with voice commands. I should change the review to 1 star again. I'm too tired and need to get up after a couple of more hours of echo show torture.

And after a single day of fighting with this stupid Amazon Echo Show and then returning it, I feel vindicated and won't be dabbling in the Amazon/Alexa ecosystem again.I bought the Echo Show to pair with a Blink doorbell. I simply wanted to get an audible alert and video feed when someone pushed the doorbell in our upstairs bedroom, and the combination was recommended as a simple and economical way to do that. As a bonus, I figured the Echo Show could serve as a digital alarm clock and allow my wife to listen to her podcasts while she was upstairs.But setting up the Blink with the Echo Show was anything but simple, even though they're both Amazon devices. First, I had to install the Blink app on my phone and create a new Blink account (why?), then *also* install the Alexa app on my phone. I don't want to install Alexa and don't need another voice assistant; I'm happy with my Google Assistant. Then I had to figure out how to teach Alexa a new ""skill"" to listen for the doorbell press, which took a lot of Googling to figure out. The result? Alexa simply says aloud that there's someone at the door, but does not automatically show the video. But Blink also alerts my phone, and it's actually simpler to tap on it to show the video than get Alexa to do it.Then there was the matter of getting this to simply show a clock the rest of the time. Though this device seems designed to look just like a nightstand alarm clock (who would actually watch movies on this 5"" screen?), getting it to only show a clock proved almost impossible. Apparently you have to go into the ""Home Content"" and disable each and every one of the several dozen things it wants to show you by default, from recipes to sports scores to news stories to Amazon delivery updates to ads. (And then do it again when Amazon automatically adds new items to the list.) I did all of that and followed the instructions I found to only show a clock. The end result was it that it showed a clock superimposed over a clock, then would flash after several seconds, show an entirely different clock, flash again, show nothing, etc. Seriously? How do you screw up something so simple as a clock? And apparently I'm not the only one who has run into this buggy behavior.I appreciate that many people like Alexa devices and all that they can do. But I'm steering clear. If I want to watch a movie, I'll do it on my TV or tablet. If I want to listen to music, I'll fire up the Sonos. For everything else, I vastly prefer my phone or desktop computer to this small, buggy, ad-ridden device that is too smart to simply show me the time.",https://www.amazon.com/All-new-release-display-clearer-Glacier/product-reviews/B09B2QTGFY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1

Then another one was shipped quickly, got it and it wouldn't connect to the WiFi no matter what, all the other Echo's were fine and happy, except Echo 8 is not getting annoying, not working properly, the features are dying.  So I sent it back and they sent me a replacement, of course, there was no plug. They didn't tell me not to send the plug from the defective #2.

About a month ago, the screen began randomly going dark, and asking the thing to show the home screen got me nowhere. Folks, this thing basically has one job that other Echos don't have, and that job is to show things. I'm about ready to take it out to an empty field with a baseball bat, and I am not a violent person. But the Echo Show has driven me to it. Just know that when I appear on America's Most Wanted.

Unknown,R2P2Q1EGK1FCPC,Positive,"Amazon Echo Show 5 (3rd Gen, 2023 release) | Smart display with 2x the bass and clearer sound | Glacier White",4.4,5.0,"35,562","I've been using the Amazon Echo Show 5 (3rd Gen, 2023 release) for a few weeks now, and I am thoroughly impressed with its performance. The Echo Show 5 has always been a reliable smart display, but this latest version truly steps up the game, especially in terms of sound quality.**Sound Quality:**One of the standout features of this Echo Show is its upgraded sound system. With 2x the bass and clearer sound than its predecessors, the audio quality is surprisingly robust for such a compact device. Whether I'm listening to music, catching up on the news, or watching videos, the sound is rich and immersive. It's perfect for smaller rooms, like the kitchen or bedroom, where you want good audio without the need for a larger speaker.**Display and Design:**The 5.5-inch screen is sharp and vibrant, making it great for watching short clips, checking the weather, or making video calls. The compact design fits easily on any shelf or counter, and the Charcoal color gives it a sleek, modern look that blends well with any decor. The screen's adaptive brightness is a nice touch, adjusting automatically based on the room's lighting.**Smart Features and Alexa Integration:**As expected from an Echo device, the Alexa integration is seamless. Voice commands are picked up easily, even from across the room, and the responses are quick and accurate. I use it to control my smart home devices, set reminders, and even follow along with recipes. The new smart display features also make it easier to see and control multiple smart home devices at once, which is a huge plus for someone like me who has a lot of them.**Privacy and Security:**Amazon has included a physical shutter for the camera, which provides peace of mind for those who are concerned about privacy. There's also a mic/camera off button, which is easy to use and effectively disables both the microphone and camera.**Overall Performance:**The Echo Show 5 (3rd Gen) is a fantastic addition to any smart home setup. It offers a great balance of audio quality, smart features, and privacy controls. Whether you're new to smart displays or looking to upgrade, this device is definitely worth considering. It's small but mighty, and I find myself using it more than I expected for everything from checking my calendar to watching cooking videos.",https://www.amazon.com/All-new-release-display-clearer-Glacier/product-reviews/B09B2QTGFY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1

Music sounds very good and the slideshow on the home screen fun to watch. It easily links with other devices and controls them seamlessly. The negative is that the camera doesn't work at all. I ordered the first Echo 5 on July 21. After setting it up, I quickly determined that the camera wasn't working. I spent 45 minutes chatting with a tech who finally gave up and arranged for an exchange. The exchange unit arrived a couple of days later. I set it up and again the camera didn't work. When I try to view the camera image on the Alexa app an alert appears on the Echo that someone is trying to view the camera via the app. On the app I get a notification that live view not available now, try again later. When I ask the Echo to show the camera on its screen, it says ""I don't know what's wrong."" I like the other features enough that I've decided to keep the device, as the camera not critical to me. However, it is annoying and if the camera is important to you, keep this in mind.",https://www.amazon.com/All-new-release-display-clearer-Glacier/product-reviews/B09B2QTGFY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1

I was very excited to go my apple watch and when it came, it looked legitimate. However after only a half a day of use, the watch quickly started showing signs of concern. First, there was a constant lag in the touch screen. Then, when trying to connect to my cell service, it was never getting calls as it should. Therefore, I brought the watch to an actual Apple Store for help. Literally while seated working with the IT tech person at Apple, the watch would not stop glitching, they could not figure out why the cell service was not working, and to TOP IT ALL OFF... the watch was on 2% so she plugged in a super charger and placed the watch on to get some charge. Apparently these chargers are supposed to get watches up to a minimum of 50% in 10min. While working with the IT person and waiting we noticed the watch WAS NOT CHARGING AT ALL and ultimately ended up dying and would never turn back on. The watch would not charge and that is when the tech stated it is likely NOT a new watch as advertised and rather a refurbished watch that simply won't work due to a poor refurbish. Apparently this is VERY common with apple products on Amazon so BEWARE. Long story short, I learned my lesson. DO NOT BUY apple products outside of an official Apple Store.<END RANT>Good luck!",https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Cellular-Smartwatch-Precision-Extra-Long/product-reviews/B0DGHRFYMM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1

What would happen if I was out late? I would have a dead watch. And since I use the watch at the gym as well as apple maps, the battery would go quickly.So I decided to get the Ultra 2. Could I justify buying an $800 watch just for longer battery? I was iffy at first, but I am SO grateful that I pulled the trigger. Not only is this thing a beast with battery life, I am finding more features that I didn't even know it had.First, when I ping my phone using my watch, a numerical distance pops up on the watch face and tells me how many feet I am away from the phone. And as I walk around my house, the numbers go down when I'm closing in on my phone. This is such a nice little feature (maybe for those who are in a loud house and can't hear the ping, or if it's under the couch cushions and the sound is muffled. I have this exact feature  when I'm using my phone to locate my Airpods. I'm very glad they added it to the watch.Additionally, the display is amazing. The keyboard looks so much sharper and more crisp when texting, and the size allows for additional complications. I can see the weather, the high and the low, chance of rain, time and date, battery life, etc. all in one glance.I'm even excited to use the Wayfinder feature! If you are hiking and you see a waterfall or a bridge, you can mark it and pin the location. You can then basically build a map of all the things you see, so you can loop back to it, or if your going on a curve, you can say ""We're about to loop back towards the old bridge we were just at."" You can even use the ""Backtrack"" feature which will guide you to retrace your steps so you'll never get lost in the woods again.There's a ""Where did I park my car?"" feature that will guide you back to your car, as well as a ""Siren"" feature that will begin to emit a loud sound that can be heard in a large radius in case you are in danger or need help.These are only some of the very cool features that are included on the watch.Now, was I worried that going from a 40mm to a 49mm be too much? Yes.IS it too much? NOT AT ALL! I don't think it's too big, and it's not heavy at all. I am very glad I got the watch.

The flat braided cord does feel really premium and durable. It's also very compact, which makes it easy to place as it won't take up too much room. That said, it seems like a couple corners were cut to achieve this design. The most significant one is charging speed - there is no fast charging of any sort, and the 15W total output means you can only charge a phone and maybe something very low-power, such as earbuds. Trying to charge two devices at once or anything power-hungry, such as a power bank, will result in very slow charging. The other compromise to the design is that the placement of the 2-prong outlets makes it so you can't mount it to a table without making these plugs inaccessible to bulkier chargers.So the product itself is very mediocre and not exactly the all-in-one power hub it appears to be. There's also pricing shenanigans going on - at the time of writing, the 5ft version is $40 and the 6ft version is $12 (on ""sale"" from a list price of $20.)

One for each vehicle.  Anyway, the first one (this one) i bought lasted 1.5 year and completely died by getting frozen and turning on and off. Cycling over and over. Beeping like mad. I got ahold of the company even though i was half a year out of warranty.  I will say  the company had amazing customer support. And they checked in with me as well. They still shipped me another one. I was grateful for so i didn't have to  re- run wires for a different brand. At this point since the view was clear as it is a food little camera and customer service was great, i figured for our car show vehicles I'd  buy 2 more. I am gladni didn't... 3 weeks later the 2nd one i bought ( not this one but it's older version) died after 1 year and 3 months. It did the same stuff as this one. Since it is in my truck and takes 5x less time to run wires than our SUV, i said the heck with it. I bought a different brand.Picture quility  is good. Customer service is good. However,long term quality is terrible and I  don't  have time to re-do cameras every year. I'd like to get like2 or 3 years.  Also the looping doesnt work good at all. It wants the card reformated every so many months. Anyway We don't  see extreme heat here. Extreme cold is maybe a few times a year. No reason for them to die other than cheaply made. I almost bought another one of these so i didn't have to re-run wires but the pricing went up by 60 bucks and a ""prime sale"" to it's  normal price. That tells me the shade they throw.

What I like is that you can connect to the dash cam on the mobile app and save any and all videos you need in a flash without having to take out the SD card every time which makes it far easier to use it, and it doesn't take up a crazy amount of room on your windshield and the cable for the rear mounted camera is very long so you can hide it within the interior trim. One little downside though is that the adhesive cord clips to hold the extra or exposed cord is not sticky enough to hold it in place and with time the rear camera adhesive will give out eventually, so I found myself having to apply a stronger double sided tape to keep it in place, other than that it's worth every penny and I would recommend this dash cam to people are willing to pay a bit of a high price tag!",https://www.amazon.com/REDTIGER-Camera-Included-170%C2%B0Wide-Parking/product-reviews/B098WVKF19/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1

I like having both the front and rear cameras and love how compact they are; they are fairly unobtrusive in both locations. The front camera is mostly behind the rear-view mirror (the camera is small enough to easily fit entirely behind the mirror, but the car's OEM black box against the windshield is already occupying the ideal real estate). The rear camera is tucked up at the top of the rear window (just at the top of the rear wiper sweep area) and is barely noticeable. I liked that I could rotate the rear camera in its holder to the view angle I wanted. The cable length on the rear camera was more than sufficient to reach front-to-back in this car (and easily tucked away behind the headliner and other trim pieces), but I'm not sure if it would be enough for a full-size SUV like an Excursion. It does have an inline connector near the rear camera which was convenient when installing the rear camera and running the wire and may allow for an extension to be used.The video quality looks great. I set my front resolution down to 1080p since I feel that will be sufficient for our day-to-day needs. In my opinion, the quality of the footage will be impacted more by how clean the glass is and the weather conditions outside than the quality of the cameras.I like that I can set whether and how long the screen is visible when the dashcam is on. Most of the time, I prefer to have the displays screen off. It takes some clicking to get through all of the menus, but I found the UI intuitive and easy enough to use.The included lighter adaptor worked fine, but I got the hardwire kit (https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09WCTZ3Y8?ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details&th=1) to run permanently and to enable Parking Mode (see note below).I also got the 3M Mount (https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09SFY13TZ?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details) so I could mount the camera a bit higher behind the rear-view mirror. I'll use the suction mount and lighter adaptor when using the dashcam on trips in a rental car.You'll want to get a larger (e.g. 256 GB) High Endurance U3 SD card (https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07P4HBRMV?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_details) as the included SD card is only U1.NOTE on the hardwire kit and Parking Mode: I connected the wires as instructed (yellow->BATT, red->ACC, black->GRD) but did not see the behavior I was expecting from the dashcam: the dashcam immediately turned on even though the ACC power was off, and I could not turn on Parking Mode. This led me to believe that the documentation was wrong, so I reversed the red and yellow wires which resulted in the dashcam not turning on until ACC power was on and allowing me to set Parking Mode (or so I thought), so I felt that I had figured it out. However, I then realized that the dashcam would not stay on - it never recorded any footage while the car was on (or off). Gratefully, I found a Q&A response from ""Elizabeth B"" back on 10/7/2021 which explained how to properly set up Parking Mode (which doesn't appear to be documented anywhere with either product):1. Connect wires as described above (Yellow = constant 12v, Red = switched 12v, Black = ground).2. Turn on acc power (but do not start engine).3. Press menu button and select ""Parking"".4. While blue message box is shown on the F7N display, turn off acc power (this has to be timed well). You should see a new blue message box and the F7N unit will power off.5. Turn acc power back on (but do not start engine).6. Press menu button and select ""Parking"".7. You will now see the menu options for Parking Mode and be able to configure it how you like.credit: Elizabeth B.(Attention REDTIGER: You should include these steps in your documentation and compensate Elizabeth.)After reverting my wire connections back to match the documentation and following the steps above, my hardwired dashcam is now functioning perfectly - including Parking Mode.Even though my installation and set-up experience with the hardwire kit wasn't ideal, I do have to say that the REDTIGER customer service was outstanding! They were responsive, proactive, and empowered to do the right things for their customers. Thank you Nora!As for the apps, the Android app seems to work sufficiently well. It does take a LONG time to download the video files over the dashcam's wi-fi. I prefer to remove the SD card and copy the files directly to my PC.I'm not very impressed with the PC app (Windows 10) yet. I tried it only once, but it seemed to have a hard time after viewing the first video, and even that wasn't great. It's intended to show both front & rear video simultaneously, which I think is great, but I haven't been able to get it work very well. I'll try again and see if I can get it run better. I was surprised to discover that the rear camera records audio, so it doesn't sound great when both front and rear audio are played at the same time. I muted the rear audio and used just the front audio.The video files run just fine on third-part video players.Bottom line: I love the dashcam and rear camera; easy to use; good video; absolutely fabulous customer service.",https://www.amazon.com/REDTIGER-Camera-Included-170%C2%B0Wide-Parking/product-reviews/B098WVKF19/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1

Believe it, or not, they helped me out with that and I now have a Touch model, F7NT.I gave this five stars because this company is amazing and the cameras are superb.  I therefore did not detract a star because I am convinced that they will listen closely, make a few changes and then they will have the best possible cams.Negatives: Too many icons on the cam video screen.  The icons are too small and virtually useless because they are on your windshield, which is difficult to reach.  All this does is create confusion.Sometimes the cam wants you to turn off wi-fi to access features, which is ridiculous. Wi-Fi should always be on whenever the phone is nearby and it should record to your phone so that you can access all features as you like on your phone.  The small screen on the cam is virtually useless.Playback choices should not be visible on the cam.  Remove as many icons as possible and apply them only after video is downloaded to your phone or to a computer.Negatives: Downloading to a phone is nearly impossible or at the very least, far too tedious.Solution: Remove the SD card from the cam, utilize a thumb drive for the SD card and view your video on your laptop or PC.  There is a Redtiger Player available that you can and should download that contains all of the functions for playback of this cam.Negatives:  When playing back the video the informational text for things like time stamp, GPS, etc. shows up at the bottom of the screen, which can sometimes make it hard to read, since it's also very small.Solution: Place the informational text at the top of the screen, which generally is viewing SKY, and make it larger since this area is not of importance in any way.Negatives:  There is a time setting where when files are created, you must choose - 1 minute, 3 minutes or 5 minutes.  Thereby after downloading files you can select from a bunch of files, presumably to facilitate finding the file you wanted.  Still tedious indeed.Solution: As the cam is recording, allow the recording to directly access and download to your phone without interruption.  Perhaps have a 1 hour period and then over write to withhold no more than one hour on your phone.  If there has been an occurrence you can simply SAVE the file.  To view it you could easily see it on your phone or you could send it to your big screen tv.  The SD card would merely become a backup for emergency situations.Bottom Line:  The suggestions above are really about User Friendliness. If anything, I believe that they have attempted to input too many features.  I'm recommending simplifying the process with slightly different thinking.  I also recommend buying the Touch model, as without it, it's somewhat awkward to use.  The picture quality is great, front and back and the service is excellent.  You get what you pay for.The method of operation and the thought pattern for usage should be that you view your video on a laptop, or pc, on the Player app that is provided.  In short, the cam records, the app provides viewing via computer.  I really like the app since it provides both front and rear at the same time, plus you can zoom the view and even choose only front or only back as you like.  All info is visible like GPS, a google may of travel, speed of travel, date and time.  This app is a very important part of the operation.  Still it could use a bit of tweaking.  Overall, I love this thing.  I can't imagine what it would have been like to have this in the early 80s when I was a private investigator.",https://www.amazon.com/REDTIGER-Camera-Included-170%C2%B0Wide-Parking/product-reviews/B098WVKF19/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1

Easy to install in my new 2024 Corolla Cross.  However, there are a few inconveniences you should be aware of.1st.  If you want something that records while parked, you will need a separate cable, that goes to the fuse box.  I have not tried this and not sure if that is difficult or not.2nd. The Wi-Fi is direct, in other words strait connection to your phone.  Dies not connect to the Wi-Fi in your house or other locations.  The only problem with this is, if you phone is automatically connect to Apple Car Play, the Wi-Fi will not connect to your phone.  After disconnecting car play, you must go through the menu of the unit and re-enable the Wi-Fi option before you phone can see it and connect.  The downloads are very slow, I would recommend you remove the SD card and download what you want directly to the computer, works must faster.3rd The main cable included is a lighter adapter cable, which is fine if you light adapter is near the front console.  Mine is inside the arm rest storage area, and this cable is not long enough to place the front camera where I want it.  Would be nice if there was a USB-C (This is the new and established connections in newer cars) power cable included.4th.  The wire clips aren't very good and only have a few, I had to buy better and extra clips for under the dash run.

I turn on the card, it starts recording from both the front and rear.Wasn't too bad to install, and I like that it has a smaller vertical profile compared to some others - doesn't obscure the windshield as much. The tools it came with made it easy to run the cable for the rear cam - Most of the cable is hidden in my car's panels/trim, and the little cable ties for routing helped with the rest (in fact, those cable ties are so convenient I kind of wish I had more).If there's one thing I wish was different, it's that the rear cam would come with a suction cup - just in case it needs to be moved/removed or if you get the tilt slightly off the first time you mount it.I don't mind that it came with a small memory card because I replaced it with a big high-endurance one anyways.I also turned off the GPS and audio recording parts since that seemed excessive to me - and I like that it has options for that.

You do have to install it and for me it was relatively easy because I’m a AV technician already but if you don’t have experience, you’re set up may not be as smooth and clean. The parking mode requires you adjusting your fuse box in your car, which personally I did not want to do. Instead, I bought a back up battery that I can plug the camera into when my car is parked. Lastly, the camera does not rotate 360 so you can’t see what’s going on inside the car or on the side of your car. To solve this issue, I am buying another camera that’s front facing that spins 360°.

Unknown,R13W98AUMKI9BG,Critical,"Amazon Echo Pop | Alexa fits in anywhere: bedroom, living room, bathroom, office, and small spaces | Charcoal",4.7,2.0,"67,108","I bought the Echo Pop when it was on sale, thinking that it could be handy for occasional use. I set it up in my bedroom where it was less than 30 feet from my router. My interest in the device was casual but I thought it might be nice to use my voice to ask it to play some calming music while I was falling asleep or to give me the forecast when I was dressing for the day. I figured that I would eventually find more uses for it.I connected it to my Spotify account and with a little set up work, I could ask it to play some calming harp music and it did. Lovely. Until it didn't. I asked it what was wrong and it was unresponsive.I looked up what to do in such cases and I was given simple instructions to reset it. At first, this seemed to work and it would come to life again, willing to follow my simple requests. But then it went offline again. Several times in the same day. Reading more instructions, I rebooted my router and the little device seemed happy and responsive again.Until I wanted to use it a day or two later. This was puzzling and frustrating as my other devices were not having any trouble nor did they require me to frequently reboot my browser.Last night, I gave up. I wanted some soft music while I was getting ready for bed and I asked it for some. Nothing. The little Pop seemed dead as a doornail. I did the reset maneuver, and nothing happened. Not a flicker of light across its bar. I was not about to reboot my router again. It was late and I was tired.I don't know if my device was defective and I could have asked for product support but, at this point, I no longer cared.

Unknown,R1KUEC5VRA4XLM,Critical,"Amazon Echo Pop | Alexa fits in anywhere: bedroom, living room, bathroom, office, and small spaces | Charcoal",4.7,2.0,"67,108","Honestly the functionality is fine. The speaker works, basic questions can get answered, alarm function is good, connection to Spotify is pretty good, etc.Our issue is the constant tweaking and changing that occurs in the software itself. It really does appear that Alexa is programmed to constantly figure out new ways to bother you. It reminds me of a loud kid's toy that sounds like it's off and then suddenly yells out, ""DON'T YOU WANT TO PLAY WITH ME?!"" Amazon doesn't seem content with allowing Alexa to be something that sits on your desk and functions the way you want it to function, without bothering you in any way. They haven't made something that can just sit on your desk and function the way you ask it to function.We have every single notification turned off, we've turned on ""brief mode"" which is supposed to make Alexa speak as little as possible. Still, no matter what we do, Amazon seems determined to program Alexa to ask us questions for every question we ask, sometimes completely out of left field. It's like the thing gets more and more desperate to be useful beyond the functions we've designated. At first, when asking for the weather today, it would constantly ask if we wanted the weather for the whole week. No. I said today because I want today's weather. Eventually that stopped, but then it started asking completely random stuff. The most recent one was, after asking the weather, it asked if I want to be updated on new movies as they come out. What? It's ridiculous. If I want the weather, now I just Google it.Setting timers, same thing. You'd think set a timer, how easy it is. No, it asks questions about entertaining you while you wait. Or other random things that have nothing to do with what you just asked. No, please just set a timer. If I don't have one handy and I need a timer now, I just have Google do it.My daughter was really enjoying asking how many days until Christmas and her birthday, and for a long time, Alexa would give the number of days. Now it has switched to months and weeks. I didn't ask how long until this event. We specify ""how many days"" and now no matter how I ask the question, some programming change has made it impossible to get the number of days. My daughter's little morning ritual is gone. She loved asking and hearing the reply, but now I just Google it and she's learning to read the numbers instead. Even with those very simple questions, though, it would ask things like ""would you like to hear a Christmas joke?"" No. I just want to be told the number of days and then have the device go quiet.There are many other little issues here and there. For a while, brief mode seemed to stop all of that, but it's back full force and I can't figure out how to shut it off. Probably many neurotypical people won't understand how stressful it feels, but not knowing if the device will just be silent after I ask my question, and never knowing what it will say or ask makes me never want to use it. My autistic son unplugged his because he couldn't stand it, either. I thought it would be so helpful, and I bought multiples for our house, but honestly there are plenty of other options out there for all of the functionality of this thing when I need it. I was hoping it could be centralized in one thing, but in their desperation to make the Alexa devices oh-so-useful and indispensable, Amazon has made them annoying, especially for anyone with any kind of neurodivergence.",https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Echo-Alexa-fits-anywhere/product-reviews/B09WNK39JN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1

The Echo Pop is more compact and affordable than other Echos. It fits easily in my dorm and is easy to pack when moving between home and school.Favorite features:It reads my Google Calendar events to me, and I set personalized wake-up, evening, and unwind routines so that I have the external motivation to do what I need to do at the right times. I also like that I can set multiple timers/reminders without having to go on my phone, so it feels like I have a personal assistant.I think the audio quality is pretty good as well, and I can pull-up my Spotify playlists (although if you give your playlists some complicated long name, it can be a bit harder). I usually just like to get Alexa to pull up the specific song or artist I feel like listening to at the moment and loop it though.Improvement:Because of school I use both Apple & Google products , and it's a bit frustrating not to be able to directly sync Alexa better with the Apple ecosystem. While it reads Google Calendar events, I'd like if Alexa could also see, create, and remind me of my Google Tasks, or do this with Apple Reminders. Currently, you'd have to check the Alexa app for notes that you create with Alexa, and there are no helpful widgets or syncing tools that work well for making this information more accessible.Also I think the routines feature could be more flexible. Currently, if you want routines to activate at different times on weekdays versus weekends, you have to manually copy and create new routines, but I don't want the extra clutter.Some other considerations:Note that the Echo Pop needs to be plugged in at all times to function, so it requires setup every time you move it to a different room. I recommend getting a battery base if you want the flexibility to move it around, such as taking it to a common room or for listening to music while showering.Overall, it has still added a lot of structure to my days, so I'd recommend it!",https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Echo-Alexa-fits-anywhere/product-reviews/B09WNK39JN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1

Its compact size makes it perfect for small spaces like my kitchen counter, bedroom nightstand, or even my office desk. The fabric finish adds a touch of elegance, making it a stylish addition to my home decor.**2. Exceptional Sound Quality:**Despite its small size, the Echo Pop delivers impressive sound quality. The audio is crisp and clear, with a surprisingly robust bass that enhances my music, podcasts, and audiobooks. Whether I’m hosting a small get-together or relaxing with some background music, the Echo Pop exceeds my expectations every time.**3. Seamless Integration with Smart Devices:**Setting up the Echo Pop was a breeze. It seamlessly integrates with my other smart devices, allowing me to control my lights, thermostat, and security system with just my voice. Alexa responds quickly and accurately to my commands, making my daily routines more convenient and efficient.**4. Versatile Functionality:**The Echo Pop is more than just a smart speaker. It serves as a hub for my smart home, a personal assistant for reminders and calendar updates, and an entertainment center for streaming music and checking the weather. The Drop In feature is particularly useful for staying connected with family members in different rooms.**5. Privacy and Security:**Amazon has prioritized privacy with the Echo Pop. The microphone off button gives me peace of mind, knowing that I have control over when Alexa is listening. The device also features multiple layers of security to protect my personal information.**6.

At that price, these little smart speakers are well worth it. However, at the list price, you might do better to spend another $10 and go for the Echo Dot. Better still, if you can pick up an Echo Gen4 as certified refurbished, then that is quite a good deal at around $50.Prior to purchasing the Echo Pop, I installed the Alexa App on my iPhone, and during order time, I did the pre-configuration. Upon arrival, the setup was a breeze, and in a matter of just a few minutes I was greeted by a pleasant sounding female voice. The audio quality of this little speaker was amazing. I asked it a few questions, then said “Alexa, play Peaceful Current Radio.” It was a truly Hi-Fidelity experience, even though it was monophonic. On that station, a great deal of the music is solo acoustic, so stereo , 3D, or surround sound isn’t necessary to hear the clear and faithful reproduction of a piano, guitar, or cello. The bass from this speaker isn’t going to rattle the walls, but the little speaker was able to fill my master bedroom with beautiful music, that sounded like the instruments were in the same room.That should cover the good points about this smart device. I rarely give any product 5 stars, but if I could give it a rating of 4.5 I would, primarily because of what it can do at such a low sell price. There are some issues that you might want to consider if you are looking for a good Echo Device. It is far from perfect. Its smarts are at the low end, and a good Wi-Fi connection is needed if you want a fast response. It can’t function as a hub, so if you want to control various smart devices in your home, you will likely need an Echo Gen4 or better. It doesn’t have a 3.5 mm audio jack, so if you want to connect to headphones or external speakers, you will need to use Bluetooth. The Bluetooth connection can be tricky, but once you pair with speakers, it quickly disconnects and reconnects by just turning off the speakers and turning them back on. I also found out that after doing this several times, it began to experience streaming problems, and I had to unplug it and plug it back in to fix the problem.Bluetooth streaming seems to suffer a bit in fidelity. I paired it with some Logitech Bluetooth computer speakers, and even though it produced stereo sound, the frequency response was not as good, and the stereo separation was weak. Some of this was likely due to the Logitech speakers. They aren’t exactly the best computer speakers and I am not too fond of the passive radiator design that gives the base an unnatural sound.I tried a separate GT Bluetooth to 3.5 mm adaptor, which I connected to my retro audio system, and the sound quality was a little better, but I had to crank the volume knob up pretty high. When I connected the Bluetooth adaptor to wired headphones it sounded pretty good, so using Bluetooth headphones seems a good alternative listening method.One other issue is with the alarm level. I can’t seem to set it to a level that will override the music, and alert me that it’s time to take medications or walk the dog. It usually takes me awhile to realize that it is sounding a wake-up. It is loud enough when not playing music, but too low of a level when music is playing.Overall, it is a very good device, and its small size makes it easy to place in an out of the way location, such as in the kitchen or bathroom. It has great sounding audio that can fill a small room, but not quite good enough to fill a large family or living room. It really shines at playing relaxing music such as from an Internet radio station such as “Peaceful Current Radio,” or other similar music stations. However, for Rock- and Roll or party music, you will likely want something with a little more punch.Update:I just had to do a follow up to my previous review. I caught a sell and picked up another Echo Pop for just under $20. That means I acquired 2 of these for around $45 with tax. They make a great stereo pair. Two speakers are better than one. You get double the sound. This means a great improvement in the base response. With 2 drivers pushing the air, they do a better job. I just tweak the bass response 2 notches, and the treble 1 notch, and these rival the audio quality of my much larger and more expensive JBL studio monitor bookshelf speakers with a 100 watt per channel amplifier pushing them. Of course they can’t match the power, but 2 of these in a stereo pair can do a pretty good job in my 13 by 13 master bedroom with vaulted ceiling. I’m considering adding an Echo Sub hidden away under my bed.Alexa does a much better job at finding my favorite Internet radio stations as well. Siri keeps telling me she can’t find that in my Apple music library.I have a database of URLs to over 9000 radio stations. Alexa easily finds most of my favorites such as:Peaceful current RadioNew Standard WNYCIPR Studio 1KTUX FMKSRY FMWJIB FMCafé Del Mar RadioAmericana Boogey RadioAloha JoeQuiet Village RadioWSBZ FMSmooth Jazz 101WABE ClassicalJust ask Alexa to play any of these, and get ready for a treat.",https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Echo-Alexa-fits-anywhere/product-reviews/B09WNK39JN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1

Unknown,R1U1IT3UD2BDK1,Positive,"Amazon Echo Pop | Alexa fits in anywhere: bedroom, living room, bathroom, office, and small spaces | Charcoal",4.7,5.0,"67,108","This has a better speaker than my relatively new Alexa with a screen, which is great because I use them a lot for music. It was super easy to set up with the Alexa app since I have another, it only took 2 minutes to set up. I haven't had any issues so far. We use this one in the bedroom for alarms, music, and to turn off the smart lights in the house when going to bed. I like that this one doesn't have a camera or the screens that's constantly showing amazon ads, our other one is basically a shopping billboard so we shoved it into a storm trooper helmet and named her Kevin... who needs the screens anyway? With the screen, I guess you can do the family photo display, but it still is at least 60% ads instead of a digital photo display like I was promised. They advertise the screened Echos with things like 'oh you can watch cooking videos and the news and do a family photo screen saver"" but that is what I have a phone for, if I need to watch something I'm more likely to use a TV or a laptop or even an iPad or my phone, the Echo is a last resort that will never happen. My phone has an easier interface, and its own AI assistant. Theyre also like ""you can video chat your amazon contacts"" but amazon is not social media, I'm not gonna collect amazon contacts and video chat them, and have yall head or facetime,,, or a phone?? Like no thank you, the screen on these things is just annoying and not aesthetically pleasing with all the weird ads that it didn't used to have, I never even see the screensaver with the time showing in forever and can't change the settings because amazon wants it to be a billboard. I really liked the screen when it used to be the time and I could use it as a clock, but no longer, that was the only thing I liked on the screen. Get the Pop instead, it's cheaper and wildly better. All the extra features they offer you for other models are a scam and you'll never use them, the Pop is great. I wish they'd bring back the panda face version, that one was cute.",https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Echo-Alexa-fits-anywhere/product-reviews/B09WNK39JN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1
Unknown,RAZDNZHIEAFX1,Positive,"Amazon Echo Pop | Alexa fits in anywhere: bedroom, living room, bathroom, office, and small spaces | Charcoal",4.7,5.0,"67,108","I found a great Prime Day deal on Kasa smart plugs, and though I already have an app to control them, I decided to see if the Echo Dot they're compatible with was also on sale.  That's when I happened across this Echo Pop for less than half price -- yay Prime Day!  I had seen it before, but I kind of dismissed it, since I have no need for any speakers.  I simply didn't realize that a smart speaker isn't just for playing music and podcasts.  Fortunately, I took a closer look this time and realized this Echo Pop was exactly what I needed!It was super-easy to set up, thanks in large part to being able to connect it to my Amazon account before I even completed check-out.  Now I can get the weather forecast, set reminders and alarms, and control my smart plugs by just talking to Alexa.  My smart plugs control lamps, fans, and things I want to be sure I always turn off or better yet, unplug, and I can now do all of that by talking to this Echo Pop.  I set up a second Echo Pop up in my bedroom, and I love how it works.  It tells me to get up, turns on my lamp, so I can't turn over and fall back asleep, and pretty much replaces my old style alarm clock.  I feel kinda dumb for not giving the Echo Pop a closer look when it first came out, but then again I'm glad I got it on super sale!Update: while I'm just loved controlling my smart plugs and devices through with voice with the Echo Pop or through the Alexa app on my phone, I decided I also needed an Echo Show, so I could check my security camera feeds. Big mistake. Although I got a $30 deal through Amazon Warehouse, the Echo Show was a big disappointment, slow to respond and much more tedious to set up thanks to a million options. Plus, it was absolutely loaded with annoying ads. Within 2 hours, I missed the perfect performance and simplicity of my awesome little Echo Pop, so the Echo Show went back in the box for a refund, and I'm back to enjoying life with my Echo Pop.I've also since purchased a third Echo Pop, this one in Midnight Teal to put in my bathroom.  Sounds like a strange spot, but hear me out.  I'm an older woman who lives alone, and I subscribe to the Alexa ""Call for Help"" service, and since a slip and fall in the bathroom isn't an impossible situation, I thought it would be smart to make sure a speaker is nearby when I'm in there as well.  Plus, the Midnight Teal is an almost exact match for the color scheme in that room, so clearly this is meant to be.",https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Echo-Alexa-fits-anywhere/product-reviews/B09WNK39JN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1

Unknown,R51JODWPKTYLW,Critical,"Amazon Echo Dot (5th Gen, 2022 release) | With bigger vibrant sound, helpful routines and Alexa | Glacier White",4.6,3.0,"129,480","The product looks quite sharp. The design look is quite pleasant and the volume and sound quality are remarkably good for a unit the size of a softball. The WiFi range is lacking, severely. My office is the farthest room away from my router but she is the only device with connectivity issues. I have a 2012 laptop that gets 4 bars in the same spot. She gets about 2. The voice recognition software is very impressive. She can distinguish my voice clearly from others with a room full of several chatting people and music/tv going in the backround. I have a very odd accent as I've spent each quarter of my 40 years in a different corner of the United States but she seems to have adapted rather easily and rarely fails to understand a command on the first try. I pulled stars because despite all her new bells and whistles she seems to have lost quite a bit of her playfulness and more basic commands. When she misunderstands a command, she does not even get it close and I get a lot of the defacto ""I'm sorry I can't do that"" responses to simple queries. When I was younger I remember sitting having an hour long smart-alec b.s. trash talking session with my uncle's Alexa. This one is boring and no fun to joke around with. She also cannot retain instructions and preferences by voice. Some can be done via the app. But if I wanted to interact with the app on my phone, I wouldn't have bought the pod. I've told her endless times that Spotify is my preferred music player, but unless I specify Spotify in the command she defers to Amazon music. Overall she's become more Amazon's than my own product. Much less independent. Amazon should be giving these away for free for the amount of permission and intrusions needed just to use her. It claims she can integrate with any Bluetooth audio device. This is a lie. She can scan and find her own products no problem but my expensive non-amazon Bluetooth audio devices are invisible to her. The Alexa accessories like light switches, cameras, speakers, thermostats are fairly cheap and basic and allow little to no user customization or expansion. The level of integration is also very basic. About as complex as simply getting a ""clap-on/clap off"" light switch. Now if there was a smart plug hub where I could plug in all my office devices and instruct her to power on my workstation upon entry to my office(meaning activate my computer, desk light, air conditioning, and interactive display) but leave the rest of my electrical devices plugged in there deactivated unless instructed otherwise, that would be neat. I'm also somehow quite uncomfortable with giving her access to any cameras in her home as we know Alexa has behaved as a spy and unauthorized gatherer of personal information in the past. This model has a ""privacy mode"" based on the honor system and a very reassuring red light to designate this.  Yeah, trust is a hard thing to get back once you've betrayed it. She does not have a battery. This is a major design flaw. My 20 year old clock radio has a backup but my brand new Alexa does not. So every single time we lose power or I have to unplug her to move her, I have to go through the ENTIRE process of putting her back into setup mode, reconnecting her to my wifi. An absolute insufferable pain. Also, she does things for no apparent reason, which again makes me nervous. Normally when idle or not in a set mode, her base black out. Occasionally I will be watching her and she will just begin to pulse a color at the base for random periods of time for no explainable reason. I've asked her to explain herself and she plays dumb. Sometimes a song will come on in shuffle play that I will like and I will ask her afterwards to identify the last song she played. She cannot do this. I ask her to identify the last task I had her perform, she cannot do this. I ask her why she is blinking, she cannot do this. She can adjust her volume up or down one small phase at a time verbally, but mutes the music while executing the command but does not pause it. To go from very quiet to very loud is a process of about 30 seconds, 10 requests, and a starting over of the track. Overall she is limited, does not learn. Little to no AI, and is mostly an exercise in frustration rather than convenience. Another MAJOR design flaw, she cannot be made to respond only to my voice or to refuse a specific voice. We learned this the hard way with my young nephew who spent a good 20 minutes playing hit or miss demanding calls to names he was guessing from my address book and even our local police. A 5 year old is going to stupid things. A 5 year old is going to talk to and play with damn near anything that will play with it.  How in god's name did no one at Amazon think it a good idea to put a ""parent"" or ""owner"" mode where she answers only to my voice, or uses that amazing voice recognition software to single out and restrict a voice. Does anyone at Amazon have children? Or do they simply not like Amazon products either? If you are willing to do things her way, she can be an asset. If you want something that can adapt to and work with you, she's a frustration and a liability. If you want an attractive centerpiece for your livingroom to impress your friends with your ""smart house"", shes perfect. I thought newer would be better. Overall I'm dissapointed with this product and miss my echo dot.",https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-release-vibrant-helpful-routines/product-reviews/B09B94RL1R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1

I bought this to replace an echo dot that had a crapped out speaker. Because of it having a 3.5 jack,(which this and the other Sphere do not) I had been useing an external speaker, but the speaker needed to be plugged in all of the time and it was a pain to have lost an outlet in that location. So when this went on sale, I bought it. I like the looks of my other Sphere and it works fine. This Echo touted a better speaker. Yeah...no. Everything about it is rubbish, except its looks. It is nice looking. Volume 10 is like 7 on my others. It can't seem to hear me from places that the others could, so I have to walk with a few feet of it to get it to wake up.Couple all of this with the fact that as other AI driven things continue to improve, Alexis does not. It's a bloody battle to get it to understand what podcast so want to listen to. Half the time it just starts playing song playlist. Not even close to I asked for. I am speaking perfectly plain, understandable English. Does Amszon even pay attention to the feedback you can ""send"" through Alexia. Seems like ""not at all"" is the answer.To top it off, Amazon took away Alexia's Hoopla skill, meaning I can no longer listen to audiobooks I have checked out online from my local library.

Unknown,RUFLD9YJ96NAR,Critical,"Amazon Echo Dot (5th Gen, 2022 release) | With bigger vibrant sound, helpful routines and Alexa | Glacier White",4.6,3.0,"129,480","I’ve been wanting to upgrade my Alexa devices, and have been looking at purchasing new Dots for a long time. When I saw these Dots on sale, I purchased three of them: two to use with my relatively new Fire TV for the home theater feature (more on that in a second), and the third to replace an old Dot that died a while ago.I have a family member who’s a bit hard of hearing, and he kept jacking up the TV volume so that he could hear it. This meant that the rest of us were being blasted with audio that was too loud for our comfort. When I saw that the Echo Dots could be paired with my Fire TV for stereo sound, I thought, hey - I can put one of them right next to our favorite hearing impaired person and everyone wins! BUT NO.Straight out of the box, they were easy to set up - home theater was easy to navigate for set up, my third Dot - which I’ve only ever intended to use for podcasts, smart home tasks, purchases, etc, was also incredibly easy to get up and running (SIDEBAR: Do the remote early set up via the email that Amazon sends you because then it’s virtually plug-and-play when they arrive). For the first few hours, my home theater Dots connected to my Fire TV sounded pretty good. Mind you, this is stereo, not surround sound, but it definitely solved our problem and seemed like a fantastic solution. However, it was all down hill from there. The Dots continually fell out of sync. One was always playing like you’d expect, the other was at least a second behind. Talk about irritating. The only thing that would resolve this was turning the TV off and back on. We’d have to do that several times an hour. Not cool when you’ve just gotten to the best part of whatever you’re viewing. Other times, one or the other would go static-y. And at other times, the sound would stop playing entirely on one or the other Dot. GRRRRRRRRR. The room this is in isn’t big - the Dots are both within about 10-12 feet of the television. I scoured Amazon and the Internet looking for a solution. I even turned to Reddit. I couldn’t find anything from anyone that was helpful or useful for resolving this, but I did find other people complaining about similar issues, so I’m not the only one who’s experienced it. I really wanted this to work because it truly would have addressed a need that we have. However, as of 15 minutes ago, after two weeks of trying to get this to work, we were all so fed up and over this that we all decided collectively that having our eardrums blasted out was a far better option than the hassle of trying to get something Amazon hasn’t worked the bugs out of to work.(Amazon, if you’re reading this: I’m into tech. I’ve done more troubleshooting on this than anyone on your payroll. Fix this, please.)If you’re purchasing a Dot to use as a standard Dot, it works as intended for that and you won’t be disappointed. It’s responsive when using it to control smart home functions, it sounds okay (not fantastic) for podcasts and low key/casual background music. I cannot recommend these to anyone for the home theater feature, because it just doesn’t work. Invest in a soundbar or surround sound system instead.",https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-release-vibrant-helpful-routines/product-reviews/B09B94RL1R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1

Unknown,RI75FQO3H5O6M,Critical,"Amazon Echo Dot (5th Gen, 2022 release) | With bigger vibrant sound, helpful routines and Alexa | Glacier White",4.6,3.0,"129,480","When you buy an Amazon Alexa device, you are essentially buying a dedicated access device to talk to Amazon's computers over the internet. The device typically only has enough processing power to scan for it's wake word, and then relay what it hears afterwards to Amazon's servers, which then relays the server's response back to your Echo. Even older units like my 2nd gen dot aren't obsolete because they access the same server software as this new model, and won't become obsolete unless Amazon decides to shut those servers down or exclude an older model from service due to a hardware specific security issue.Out of the box, and after linking to an amazon account and punching in some settings, you can set alarms, timers, ask math questions, ask it to spell words for you, ask the time, check the weather, temperature (Indoors and outdoor temps with this model) and quite a bit more. Sometimes I think to myself ""I wonder if it can tell do this for me?"" and a quick question later, I discover a new function. You can further expand it's abilities by linking ""skills"" to your amazon account, which are it's equivalent of a phone app. There are also thousands of gag answers and Easter egg responses, like asking it to beam you up, or fire the torpedos, complete with matching star trek sound effects. It even has the option of asking it to answer to the name ""Computer"" (Ziggy, Echo, Amazon, and Alexa are other names you can ask it to go by at this time).Some skills are as simple as activating them from your phone, or telling the Alexa itself to enable it if you know the skill's name. Some skills need more work and account linking on the PC to set up. Skills can include audio adventure games, podcasts, specific news outlets, music streaming services you've subscribed to. My most used skill is Logitech Harmony, which links it to my Harmony hub IR blaster, a separate device I bought on sale and which allows me to turn my TV on, control it's volume, change input, mute sound, etc.For all that I enjoy about this product, Amazon makes it do SO MANY STUPID IRRITATING THINGS, and many of these issues could be resolved by adding a simple setting to turn it off. Most notable of these irritations, is the inability to turn off it's ""By the way"" messages. Imagine it's 3 am and your having trouble sleeping, and ask it what the time is. All you want is the time, but then Amazon wants you to know that ""Its 3:31pm, by the way Shaquel O'neal thinks-"" and your either issuing an order to shut it up which is itself distracting and annoying, or forced to listen to it further distract you and anyone around you from sleep. Mind you, this is with it's ""brief mode"" turned on, which is supposed to make it less talkative. Amazon also sometimes takes the liberty of adding skills to your account, like some kind of Samuel L Jackson app, and I heart Radio, which makes it fudge the details on some commands like ""Turn off Tron Bulb Delta"" (All my stuff is under the ""Tron"" name, including light bulbs) and mistakes it for a command to ""Play Trombone music"". Until I figured this out and disabled the radio skill, it was a 50/50 nightly occurrence that turning off my light groups to sleep would result in less than helpful music. Although I imagine some of these are intended to train you on it's functionality over time, if I want it to do something, Ill ask it. I don't need it telling me to "" by the way, try saying-"". Whats even more annoying is the fact it will tell you the same suggestions over and over. No Amazon, I don't want you to play white noise for me. You've told me no less than 10 times. I'm sure your proud of your white noise recordings, but I heard you the first time. STOP ASKING ME. DONT ASK ME IN THE FIRST PLACE.

I’ve been struggling for far too long without a working alarm clock, as I inevitably slam my phone alarm off without even waking up, so I thought I could maybe use this, which is ultimately why I purchased it, especially seeing that it could be connected to a light (smart lightbulb needed-I purchased the Dot package that came with one).It’s just a cute little sphere-picture shows it next to 1L water bottle for comparison. Setup took minutes. I just downloaded the app and it took care of everything. I then went to making an alarm that could actually wake me. I set the time, chose a premade sound (because who isn’t in a better mood getting woken up by The Grand Tour guys?), set the light to turn on at 30% brightness and added ten minutes of Spotify. And-it works! I still fumble groggily around for a bit, but I’m awake. I can’t slap off the Dot and my brain can’t comprehend how to talk to Alexa, so I’m stuck with light and sound, but pro compared to some generic alarm clock, I at least get to hear my music and not a horrible beeping, and the volume is set to gradually get louder, so it allows me to wake up a little more gently.  For anyone else who struggles with waking, highly, highly recommend this.I’ve only experimented nominally with the “what else” of the Dot, but it’s a pleasant surprise. I added a weather report to my mornings. I found I can set “focus time” blocks with study music. I set a reminder to make a phone call Monday morning that I would surely forget by the end of this weekend. And there’s still more to explore.Highly recommend adding in the smart light component-it’s just fun to play with the colors, but I can finally use my overhead light without being blinded since I can set % brightness.As far as the Echo itself-I’m sensitive to light at night but I appreciate that the light ring is too dim to bother me. As far as sound, I have mainly used it to listen to music to fall asleep, and I like that it can go even quieter than my phone’s speaker. I turned it up to test it, and it may not have the bass of a subwoofer, but I find it a balanced sound, better quality than listening to my phone and at least at low volume, comparable to my higher end portable speaker.Overall, an amazing deal on sale but worth the full price, imo.",https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-release-vibrant-helpful-routines/product-reviews/B09B94RL1R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1

Unknown,R3LQ4RV0UFN8EJ,Positive,"Amazon Echo Dot (5th Gen, 2022 release) | With bigger vibrant sound, helpful routines and Alexa | Glacier White",4.6,5.0,"129,480","Alexa Echo SpeakersMulti-room Music issuesI found a solution to not being able to get more than one speaker to work at a time, paired, or set up a “Multi-Room Music” in the Alexa app. This solution also fixed my inability to get Apple enabled devices connected into HomeKit, or even Google Nest Hubs to set up, period.Quick answer: Deselect “Enable Wireless Isolation” when activating your 2.4 Wi-Fi broadcast on your router.I also took all speakers off guest wifi. But I’ll try to put them back to see if that is necessary now.Back story: Months of issues with HomeKit, (only weeks with Echo Multi-Room Music), I gave up trying and decided to try Alexa and Google to replace my Apple smart home efforts. I spent way too much time. After the fix, I’ll live a blended tech life. I’ll give a quick answer, followed by my backstory: Last week I was at my wits end in utter frustration over three major roadblocks. I acquiesced and decided to try Alexa because I couldn’t get almost any of my Apple HomeKit enabled devices into HomeKit, except for new Apple products. I knew it had to be something small I was missing. Alexa was sooooo easy and quick to connect to everything, before I figured out the fix. (I dislike the echo show advertising, their echo speakers are better.) While they seemed a breeze to connect everything, for some reason I couldn’t get more than one echo speaker to work at a time. I was continually blocked from setting up Multi-Room Music or even connect a pair to play together.  Hundreds of tries. I deleted, reset, rebooted, spent over 4 hours with Comcast yesterday (thankfully a Boston native who did not put me on hold every minute like certain countries) getting my internet working again. I had rebooted my modem and router so many times, my computer got molasses slow and I feared I went too farIn interest I also decided to try a few Google nest hub speakers. Black Friday had great sales on all this stuff. Trying to set up googles hub 7 was impossible. It wouldn’t stay connected to the internet for more than a split second before “Something went wrong” message. Probably over 70 tries. (Google is better than Echo Show. Apple HomePod mini sounds crisper and better than Amazon echo 4 and mini 5’s. But Alexa is way friendlier to interact with verbally, and price point, well...)Frustration. Thursday, I broke down and bought my first Apple Homepod Mini to see if I can get that working and see if it works better than the Apple TV 4k Ethernet connection. The HomePod mini gave me a hint how to solve all these l connection and internet blocks. The HomePod mini kept telling me that I don’t have “peer-to-peer connection” allowed on my network.Now, I’m a little techy, but it took three days (ehem, months) to finally take a chance on a for granted setting I always enable on my netgear router. It’s the blasted first Wireless page when enabling a wifi broadcast.I had to deselect “Enable Wireless Isolation.”That was it. It solved every issue I have come across with smart home tech for the last 4 months, ..year.For the months that I could not solve these problems, Amazons Multi-Player Music issue made me dig deeper. I did not find anyone suggesting this particular router setting, so I thought I’d share with ppl. Tonight, I finally am able to simultaneously play music on all of my Echo speakers, connect my HomeKit enabled and Google nest hubs.I’m not sure what this will do for my/your internet security. But I’m going with it for now. And I’ll try to put all devices back onto guest Wi-Fi. I’ll never really leave Apple, but after interacting with other smart speakers, it’s probably not going to be my main go to for speaker or answers to questions. Or I’ll just get too creeped out by Google and Amazon invasiveness and acquiesce with Apple instead. Echo Dot 5 (this is such a sprite, great speaker!)Echo 4are my favorite for Amazon EchoEcho Studioseems the least smart, most deaf, quiet, combative, difficult to interact with, of the three speakers. Hopefully the Multi-Room music fix will improve my experience with itEcho Show 8Meh. Far too much and annoying advertising of non-solicited or wanted advertisements. Least user friendly screen to work with. It sits unplugged for the most part. I mostly got this for a friend who visits who wants a YouTube fireplace playing on the tv.SIDE NOTE on other Smart Home Amazon (online, or physical store) products, related to this topic:I have been pleased with Smartbot plugs, switches and app, the Levoit 600s air purifiers and app (app goes by VeSync), and Lutron Caséta Light Switches and Dimmers, and hub. Lutron has the most stable and reliable app out there. I was fine running their apps separately. They are very nice, better than the big 3 apps. Well, back to listening to music throughout my house instead of one or two rooms. Joy!",https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-release-vibrant-helpful-routines/product-reviews/B09B94RL1R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1

I ordered one of these a few days ago, spent a few hours trying to set it up, consulted the internet, and nothing really worked. It continually got stuck at the ""searching for wifi"" step and being unsuccessful in finding *any* networks. I tried manually connecting it, using a mobile hotspot, restarting my router, etc etc etc. It could not find ANY signal at all. I called customer support, did a hard reset, tried some things, and still nothing. The lady recommended I return the device and order a new one, so I got a refund, returned the first unit, and ordered a new one.I was conflicted whether I should order this same model again or try a completely different smart speaker. Ultimately I decided to give it one more shot and I received the new unit today. Plugged it in, had guarded hopes. Again, same issue that it couldn't find a network to connect to. So I shut off Bluetooth and tried manual connection again. This time, a list of networks came up! ... but not my network. So I ""added"" my network, and it would glitch and start over. I tried half a dozen times to add my network, and it still wouldn't show up or connect. I tried another hard reset for the device, and repeated adding my network again to no avail. Back to consulting the internet! I hard reset the device, and followed a guide I found on Reddit. Still, it didn't work with my wifi network, so I had the idea to download the alexa app on my tablet and use my phone hotspot instead of my wifi. I read something that if you leave the app page for ANY reason during setup (even just the device falling asleep for a second or two), the app will glitch and connection with fail. So I hard reset the device again, added device, selected the echo dot, disconnected my tablet's bluetooth, selected manual connection in the app, then connected to the Amazon ""wifi"" network, let it search for wifi, came up with a list that didn't include mine, and so I manually added my hotspot network's name and password. It did it's little loading thing, and sent me back to the searching for wifi page. The list of networks came up again and alas, it happened! My hotspot appeared on the network page! I clicked it, feeling as though Alexa were playing tricks on me but after all my failed attempts, it finally connected! .... to my hotspot, but at least there was a shred of hope somewhere in the universe that this tiny, frustrating device had some potential, if only I could just add my personal wifi network instead!So all I had to do was spend another hour repeatedly fiddling with the app trying to add a new network so I could move it off of my hotspot to my wifi. I followed the same steps that worked for the hotspot connection (minus the hard reset) and after the third or fourth attempt, it finally connected.... And then I had to unplug it to move it to it's permanent location 10 feet away from my router- I did all this at the same outlet my router is plugged into because it was struggling so much. I considered just leaving if there for eternity because I didn't want to risk it reseting and having to deal with all the connection issues again. You have no idea the relief I felt when I plugged it into its permanent outlet and it automatically reconnected. If I had to mess with the setup process from scratch again, I probably would've just returned it again.I don't understand how this is a 5th generation device with such a flawed and frankly crappy set up process. I had to go digging through my router settings, app settings, restarted/reset the device multiple times, rebooted my router, consulted customer support, poked around multiple online forums, and spent hours trying to get this cursed little orb functioning. That said, it is now working. We'll see how it holds up over the next few weeks. If it had so much trouble finding my wifi in the first place, I'm curious to see how it'll hold up and if it will stay connected or continue posing issues. All I know is when I move out and have to set it up again in a few years.... lord help me.",https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-release-vibrant-helpful-routines/product-reviews/B09B94RL1R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1
Unknown,R1XTKWS0C2QORF,Positive,"Amazon Echo Dot (5th Gen, 2022 release) | With bigger vibrant sound, helpful routines and Alexa | Glacier White",4.6,4.0,"129,480","I got my Dot yesterday and found it easy to set up except when it came to 2 Apple-related issues. First, the Alexa app is buggy about connecting to Apple Music. It isn't just a problem with the latest version because Reddit is full of threads from 2 and 4 years ago about getting error messages after logging into an Apple account from this app. Fortunately, one of those threads pointed me to a link, on the Amazon website, where I was able to link my Apple Music account the way it should be able to be linked through the Alexa app. After that, I was able to connect Apple Music to the Alexa app, and voice commands to the Dot now work fine for listening to my playlists.Second, I had an issue using the Dot as a Bluetooth speaker to play Apple Music via AirPlay. It connects and plays the music fine, but the Dot makes extremely, ear-splitting, smoke-alarm loud announcements whenever it connects to my phone via Bluetooth. Since I was trying to use my phone in the middle of the night for ambient music to help sleep, and since this was more than loud enough to disturb my upstairs neighbors, AirPlay was a no-go. As for the previous issue, a quick search yielded years of Reddit threads about this issue, but no solutions other than to not connect any devices to the Dot via Bluetooth.So, it was a rough first day with the Alexa app failing to connect me to the music source I subscribe to - I'm guessing it works just fine for Amazon Music - and with the Dot itself making such loud announcements if I try to use AirPlay that there is just no reasonable way for me to live with the Dot as a Bluetooth speaker. But if I block the Dot from connecting with my phone, it works great as intended - with Alexa voice commands. The sound quality is as good as you'd expect from such a tiny speaker, and exactly what I wanted for bedtime music in an apartment building - very clear sound with little bass, so that I can listen to podcasts or ambient music at 2 AM and not bother neighbors.",https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-release-vibrant-helpful-routines/product-reviews/B09B94RL1R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1
Unknown,R29YOUL5AN8Y39,Critical,"Roku Streaming Stick 4K | Portable Roku Streaming Device 4K/HDR/Dolby Vision, Roku Voice Remote, Free & Live TV",4.7,5.0,"82,343","So I’ve been using Roku devices since their very first one, and one of the main uses these days is to stream my own media on Plex. I’ve been pretty slavish about using the devices from Roku that supported wired ethernet instead of relying on WiFi because I don’t want to deal with buffering or lag, and just didn’t have confidence in WiFi (despite having WiFi-6). Other streaming devices (which shall remain nameless) with WiFi-only connection have disappointed me.My previous Roku died over the holidays and so I took a chance (and a gift card) to try out this Roku 4k stick. I’m glad I did.First off, I needn’t have worried about the WiFi not being up to streaming 4k video from my server. It handles it just fine. It’s a good experience as long as you have a newer router that supports WiFi-6.Second, setup was amazingly easy. They’ve streamlined the whole process, and any apps you were already using on another Roku device are instantly logged in and ready to go. New big-name apps are almost as easy, just requiring a QR code scan and a quick login to the app on your phone.My biggest  complaint is that something about this Roku really pumps up the saturation in some of my own home-edited videos. I can’t figure out which setting is making that a thing, but it’s clearly something to do with the way my video editing app saves the video. Roku just isn’t playing nice with it, but that’s not on Roku; that’s in the editor. Everything else, however, looks incredibly good.The interface is snappy, and honestly I was shocked that this stick is faster to load and navigate than my previous Roku Ultra LT.I can think of only one negative point to the stick, and that is that it only works with the special remote it comes with, which I believe is a sort of WiFi direct connection. It won’t support an IR remote nor a Bluetooth one, rendering my universal remote useless for the Roku streaming stick 4k. It also won’t work with most of the stack of previous model Roku remotes I own. And of course, as with every Roku remote, the four quick-launch buttons are a pain in the neck. I only subscribe to one of the services in them, and will likely never subscribe to the others, which means accidentally pressing them is a bit of an obnoxious experience. I understand they’re sponsored and Roku makes money putting them on their remotes and making them permanent, but they could •at least• add two more buttons in there that are fully programmable to access the favorites we actually do subscribe to.The voice search function is handy, but sometimes the screen will prompt you to use the voice search when the normal manual actions are easier and more direct. I don’t really need to press the voice button and say “launch YouTube” when I can just press the OK button on the first app in my list (YouTube) and it launches. However, for searching for a specific movie or show, it’s a great feature. It’s also nice for people who hate typing on screen using directional buttons, as you can speak letter-by-letter to enter email addresses and passwords if need be.Bottom line: I’m impressed. Except for a few minor caveats, it’s a great streaming device that is responsive, intuitive, and provides fantastic video and audio quality, even up to Dolby Atmos in a 4k stream.Five stars.",https://www.amazon.com/Roku-Streaming-Device-Vision-Controls/product-reviews/B09BKCDXZC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1

Tip: use the USB connector on your display/TV if it has one to power this Roku streaming device. Boots up and performs quickly (noticably faster than our TCL Roku TV). Auto adapts to display’s capable resolution. Quite easy to setup (to your existing Roku account plus the included remote). Unclear, but if you have a Roku account, the apps installed on your current devices automatically populate to this device, and MOST apps copy your login(s) also, a HUGE convenience! Due to each app’s requirements, you have to register this device - so have your streaming services login info handy. I hit the online Roku site to order the free short HDMI extensionm, which processed, shipped and arrived quickly. (You might need that if there isn’t physical room to plug in this Roku streaming device directly to your display. One oddity yet unresolved (and not very important): the Roku iPhone app sees this device, but doesn’t work as an additional remote control. That does work on our TCl Roku TV. I’ve attempted no troubleshooting for that, as it’s not very important for this 2nd device, it would be merely a convenience. The remote comes with batteries.

I hated the idea of buying a new TV, (yes I know they're not that expensive), but the space where it's sat is under 48"". So I've just left it and when the grandkids come over, the downstairs TV is the one they use. I had a Firestick on it that I could NEVER get to work properly, so the TV hasn't been used in years. My soninlaw suggested I try buying a ROKU to see if THAT would work, but figured it would be a lost cause.  I DID google if it would work on older models of Sharp TV's, and I saw that yes, it should as long as there is an HDMI port (which it does).  I was able to order early this morning, and it was delivered same day about an hour ago.  I got back from running errands and decided I would TRY to do it myself before calling my soninlaw over to install it. The instructions are straight forward, I was able to take the old (stick) out of the port, install the ROKU into it, found the plug, and waited.  It went to set-up and wanted me to pair it with a remote. So..I thought I was dead in the water since I don't have one.  I've no clue WHAT button I hit, but it went to the main menu to set-up an account. I followed each screens instructions, and to my amazement, IT WORKED!!!! I turned on my favorite station, PLUTO, and tuned in to I Love Lucy.  Then added CSI to the ""favorites"" category.  From start to finish? Under 15 minutes for all of it.  I am beyond thrilled not only that when the grandkids come over they can go upstairs to watch their OWN stuff, but that I was able to do it completely on my own, no mistakes, and it works great!!!!

It makes searching for shows, adjusting the volume, and controlling playback so much easier.

The connection is stable, and the streaming quality remains consistently high.**Cons:**1. **Requires Strong Wi-Fi:** To fully enjoy 4K streaming, a strong and stable Wi-Fi connection is essential. If your Wi-Fi isn’t up to par, you might experience some buffering.2. **Limited Storage for Apps:** While it supports a wide range of apps, the internal storage is limited, so you might need to manage your app installations carefully.Overall, the Roku Streaming Stick 4K is an excellent investment for anyone looking to enhance their streaming experience.

It streams in 4K and is much smaller than the old Roku puck devices. Also, if you have an open USB slot on your TV, you can plug this device into it for power using the supplied chord and have a very clean installation without taking up another power outlet!Note that the supplied cable has an in-line dongle that is necessary for the stick to work properly, so do not buy a smaller USB cable for the installation, just bundle up the extra cord length with a zip tie behind your TV.I was surprised at the 4K quality provided by this streaming stick, it might actually be superior to the puck style Rokus because it plugs directly into an HDMI port and doesn’t rely on the thin HDMI cables that Roku supplies with their other units (which I believe degrade the signal somewhat as it travels the length from the puck Roku to the TV).Another nice thing about this unit is that it uses REPLACEABLE AAA BATTERIES rather than the rechargeable integrated batteries that Roku has been packaging with its other units. We prefer being able to remove the batteries ourselves in order to store the unit without having to worry about the built-in rechargeable batteries degrading over time.Overall, we give it a 5 out of 5 stars and wish that we would have bought these sooner!We also appreciated how quick and easy it was to setup the learning remote, with only a few button presses it was controlling our TV! It was much less hassle than we’ve had with our other Roku devices which take a while to learn how to control the TV and often forget and need to be reprogrammed over time.This small streaming stick is very portable and we will be using it to take Roku streaming with us as we travel to resorts and hotels, since we like having all of our favorite services and channels with us wherever we go.If I could replace all of the old hockey puck Rokus in my house with these, I would, but since we already have them, we will wait until they quit working to transition to Roku 4K Sticks for all of our TVs.",https://www.amazon.com/Roku-Streaming-Device-Vision-Controls/product-reviews/B09BKCDXZC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1

This really killed the device for me.Easy to overshoot if you used the finger swipe option to quickly move fast-forward or rewind.User interface, for the most part is decent and fast except for how navigates while playing.Fire TVBuilt to sell products instead of show shows, laggy, and for whatever reason I hated interacting with this device. Not being able to easily access the content I wanted due to poor organization really rubbed me the wrong way.Pro - ability to bootleg shows, but not something I'm into and I only checked this out during the first weeks of covid.I want to emphasize the lag issues.  This is built as cheap as possible to minimally meet requirements to function and it shows.RokuSo, now that I have the other devices out of the way, and ignore my LG streaming which is my favorite, I'll speak to this device and why it has my vote.This device is surprisingly fast.  I didn't expect a device that was almost as responsive as my apple TV and LG TV.  This is slightly slower but barely and no lag which is the most critical thing for me.We got this for the British Bake-off access which led to an unexpected cool thing.  The discovery of the free shows, if you don't absolutely hate commercials.  For the complete British Bake-off experience, we mute the commercials.  So, the additional channels that Roku provides has made it continue to be useful.Roku allows a preview of channels as I fast forward through it.Roku does have an issues with some apps where I need to log out and go back in so the remote works correctly.  I'm not sure if that's a bad app issue or the device but a quick back and in fixes.  The apple device has never crashed or become buggy on me.  The Firestick has, but it's cheap.The price is significantly cheaper than apple making the Roku a no brainer.Unlike the apple TV, which requires counter space, this plugs into the back of the TV and is hidden away.Now, an issue I had when I first turned on is that my remote was not communicating with the device.  I was extremely annoyed as this was an early Christmas present for my wife, and I wanted it to function within a certain time window so a return and replace would have ruined it.  The device showed the remotes power but didn't communicate.  After resetting the device, the remote works fine now.  If you run into an issue, try resetting the device.4k streaming?  It's okay.  I didn't do a side by side.  It has 4k.Navigation?  It's simple enough but could be made better. I thought the last version of the Fire TV was worse.  The apple TV does shine in this area on most apps I played with.  My biggest gripe with navigation in Roku is that marking something as favorite and then LOCATING the favorites from Roku's channels and free shows, was not intuitive.  I did eventually find my favorites, but that was frustrating.  Additionally, the channel/app/inventory searching involves clicking to the right instead of down.So, speed is slightly less than Apple, but barely.  Navigation is slightly less easy based on the layout vs apple, and i think it's better than the Fire the last time I used that thing.  The Roku has a nice access to misc. free channels.  Its price is a quarter of Apple.  The fire TV?  I don't consider these two in the same league.So, if you're picking up a streaming device, I'd recommend the Roku over the other devices (except the LG TV native streaming app which is the best I've used).  Performance and price are good.  The only reason to avoid is if it doesn't have access to what you want to watch.  For me, it filled in the gaps and provided baking shows that we otherwise didn't have access to.",https://www.amazon.com/Roku-Streaming-Device-Vision-Controls/product-reviews/B09BKCDXZC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1

My only complaint is that it sticks straight out horizontally from the ""Best"" USB port, but my tv has like a little trough there for things to go vertically. They probably were just thinking about wires collecting in the trough and not anything non-flexible. The result is that I can't plug the ROKU in there unless I'm ok with it being not 100% straight. I worry the torque will mess up the port of the ROKU. So, I had to plug it in to one of the less good ports.

The only feature it is really missing compared to a higher end Roku model is a lack of Ethernet port for people who want the strongest possible signal while streaming 4K. Mine also overheated once during the summer but has not done this ever again and it only caused minor inconvenience for a few minutes.What isn't a minor inconvenience is how many ads there are. I've set multiple TVs up with Rokus, and the first thing I did was hide all the extra garbage that pushes movie rentals, RokuTV originals, extra menu options that funnel you into paywalls, etc. In the past year or so of using Roku, I've watched my minimalist home screen go from only a list of my apps and a single ad banner on the side, to a constant flood of advertising ploys that you can no longer hide.Like the minimalist purple default Roku home screen? Well too bad, because it's going to auto-update and change to be entirely themed around Taylor Swift to advertise her tour film. Do you want to see all of your apps on screen at once? Nope, instead you get a massive banner ad that only allows half of the apps to be visible. Paused a video for more than a couple minutes? Roku puts up a cute scrolling screen saver of a city, complete with constantly visible billboards with actual advertisements on them. Did you like how before, you could hide all the leftmost menu options to only have your apps, the store to download new apps, and the settings menu? You are out of luck, because now every couple weeks it seems like Roku updates to add a special seasonal or event menu option (sometimes multiple), so every time you want to look at options on the screen, you have to parse out which ones are functional and which ones are just advertising and directing you to something to pay for.Roku's software is incredibly scummy and overbearing with ad placement, and at the rate it has been degrading, I imagine within the next year about 80% of all screen real estate, menu options, buttons, etc. will be replaced or pushed to the side in favor of more advertisements. With competitors like Apple TV allowing you to completely hide anything you don't want to see, you have to wonder if going the cheap route for a Roku is really worth your time and invasion of your personal time.",https://www.amazon.com/Roku-Streaming-Device-Vision-Controls/product-reviews/B09BKCDXZC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1

They are absolutely unusable for my work, which involves video conferencing. This is a deal-breaker.**Pros:**- Sound Quality: The mids are nice and clear, and the bass is tight and punchy when the volume is turned up. When listening to the right kind of music at high volumes, they can sound downright amazing. I appreciate the trueness of the sound, especially given my diverse music tastes from reggae to hip hop, jazz, R&B, and EDM.- Fit: They sit very snug in my ears, effectively blocking out external sounds, which provides a passive noise-canceling effect.**Cons:**- Noise Cancelling and Transparency Modes: Both modes fall short of expectations. Transparency mode, which should let you hear your surroundings, instead adds a hollow reverb and doesn't work well; I couldn’t even hear someone talking directly to me while using it. Noise cancellation mode introduces a persistent noise layer, similar to wind or the sea, rather than effectively blocking external sounds.- Controls: The physical buttons are a matter of personal preference. For me, they are frustrating and cumbersome, often leading to accidental pausing of the music, restarting the track, or skipping to the previous track. I find touch-sensitive controls more intuitive. Maybe I'll get used to it over time, but currently, it’s quite inconvenient.- Bluetooth Range: Disappointingly low with frequent disconnections even at moderate distances. To be honest, they perform similarly to the Earfun Air Pro 3, but I expected them to be better. Maybe I need to cut them some slack since they're a year older (2021) than the Earfun Air Pro 3.- Microphone Quality: Sounds horrible and robotic on a PC, making it unusable for video conferencing or recordings. I need to test the call quality on mobile.**Conclusion:**Overall, I'm not convinced these earbuds live up to the hype or their price. Despite impressive sound quality and numerous positive reviews, I want to be objective and make an informed decision. Here are the questions I’m considering:- Am I being more critical because of the price?- Is the fact that the normal mode sounds amazing with the passive noise-canceling from the fit enough to overlook the underwhelming or broken modes?- Should I use these earbuds just for music and avoid using them for work, which heavily relies on video conferencing on PC?- Will the microphone performance be better on mobile?- Will the fit remain as good when working out or sweating?- What will happen if they fall into a puddle of water?- Can they handle 8 hours of continuous work without causing fatigue?I realize that I can’t fully trust online reviews, particularly with notable brands where reviewers might be enamoured by the brand itself or the product’s popularity. This can lead to mismatched expectations between what is advertised and what actually meets my needs.

They seem a little too quiet, and seems to vary a lot if watching movies, social media and listening to music.Pros:Extremely easy to connect to iPhone. They are made of good materials and feel good quality. They have really good noise cancelling.Overall they are decent. But I feel they are worth at most $60.

These seemed to be right in the range, granted I did add the apple warranty thing for an additional $20-30 dollars (will more than likely need it based on the battery life details below)Sound Quality (4.5/5): Good quality and base in my opinion, but I don't really have anything to compare them to.Case Quality (3/5): Case is made up of very thin plastic material with a flip open lid. I dropped this once already when getting out of my vehicle (I guess it was in my lap) and thought for sure it was going to implode on impact with the pavement, but luckily it didn't. Still questionable if it would survive a second drop though.Battery Life (1/5): I must have received a very poor pair of earbuds, because the page here shows ""24 hours with the two additional charges from the case"". If you do the math here, that's 8 hours per charge with the earbuds which is an absolute lie for the pair I received. At most, I'm getting about 90 minutes of continuous play before they are dropping to about 10-15% life. My right ear bud seems to always drain energy faster than the left ear bud as well. Typically when I check the right one is about 15+% lower than the left for battery life. IF the two charges is correct for the case, then I'm looking at a total of 4.5 hours of battery life with the two charges from the case. Very big difference here vs what was advertised, granted removing them every 90 minutes or so is ideal to prevent my ears from getting annoyed/sore with the buds being in so long.",https://www.amazon.com/Beats-Studio-Cancelling-Earbuds-Built-Bluetooth-Headphones/product-reviews/B096SRYXMP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1

Example - I come home from the gym while using these buds and I take them out to go about my normal business.

However, as soon as I went to have a phone call, my recipient could not hear me without all the background noise, so I had to turn off the earbuds and use my phone instead, which was inconvenient with my luggage, etc. In my hands.

Here were the results:Beats Fit Pro - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09JL65GNM?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsPros – These buds had some great base, and the wingtip gave them a fit that made them refuse to fall out of my ears.  But the best feature?  Physical “clicky” buttons on each one of the buds.  You press in and hear/feel the click, rather than relying on a touchscreen-like feature.  No need to guess if you tapped them once or twice, you will know.Cons – The wingtip gives a very sturdy fit, but not the most comfortable. I wouldn’t recommend to anyone with smaller ears.  The noise canceling was solid, but nothing special.  And this may be picky, but I didn’t care for most of the color schemes available.  I prefer my earbuds to be hard to notice, and even the black ones have a bright red letter “b” in the middle.Beats Studio Buds - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B096SV8SJG?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsPros – Very comfortable with the same great physically “clicky” buttons as the Beats Fit Pro.  Noise canceling seemed slightly better than average.  Great base.  Classic look.Cons – Tested during a workout, a little bit of sweat had these sliding right out of my ear.  The case for these earbuds also was the flimsiest of any I had tested, with a very weak hinge that I was scared of breaking off within the 2 weeks of using.Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08MWZHHKP?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsPros – A neat feature that I noticed only in these earbuds was that it had noise amplification as well as noise cancelation.  With one swipe in the app, the surrounding sound was actually louder and clearer than it would be without the earbuds in.  Great if you are hard of hearing, or just enjoy snooping on conversations out of reach.Cons – Similar to the Beats Studio Buds, these didn’t stay in during a workout.  They were usable, but every 10 minutes I found myself pushing them back into my ear.  And this is an opinion, but these are the ugliest earbuds out of the bunch.  The shiny black gleam made it look like a large beetle was hanging out in my ear.  No visible brand placement either, which makes them appear cheap and generic rather than the quality Samsung they are.Samsung Galaxy Buds Live - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09TBM1L3S?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsPros – Cost effective!  I added these to the test group because of the unique shape, and for that they are worth giving a try.  If you have small ears and do not like the rubber insert that is standard in most other earbuds, these may be perfect for you.Cons – Poor fit for large ears.  These were tested the least of all of the buds, because the fit was so bad for my ear shape that they wouldn’t stay in if I turned my head too fast.Bose QuietComfort  - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08C4KWM9T?psc=1&ref=ppx_yo2ov_dt_b_product_detailsPros – Bose noise canceling is unmatched.  If your primary use for earbuds is to cancel out that background white noise, this is the pair for you.  The sound quality is great, not too heavy on the base.  The case for the earbuds stood out from the rest as the only one that impressed me.  Felt very study, and I had no worries tossing it into a gym bag or cup holder.  The only case with a button latch to make sure it doesn’t open accidentally.Cons – This was the most expensive pair of earbuds by a longshot, and there were still some things I felt could be improved.  The rubber inserts had more of a “flayed” shape rather than the “rounded” shape that is standard.  My guess is that this was by design, because the earbuds were also slightly heavier than others and may need that extra in-ear grip.  The flayed shape did make them sturdier, but at the cost of them being uncomfortable in an active situation.  They were also the largest earbuds, and stuck out from the side of my head further than I would have liked.My favorite?  The beats fit pro!  While I wouldn’t recommend this pair for everyone, it was perfect for my routine.  My music taste benefits from the boosted base, and the wingtip shape was perfect for any workouts.  The feature that really convinced me was the physical buttons, something that I didn’t realize how desperately I needed.",https://www.amazon.com/Beats-Studio-Cancelling-Earbuds-Built-Bluetooth-Headphones/product-reviews/B096SRYXMP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1

They feel definitely worth the price and a all around great buy. Giving me exactly what I was looking for.For years I have used the raycon E55 and some of the features  I loved about raycon was the manual button in the earbuds, excessive bass and great inside-ear fit.Recently however, raycon has gone the way of the world— they have put sensors on the earbuds in the place of buttons and Balanced out the audio. So I began my search for new earbuds.—THE SOUND—Both the AirPods, galaxybuds and raycons I have tried tend to be balanced and prioritize giving equal notes to all instruments For a clear and concise sound, But to someone who is not an audiophile it sounds very flat and devoid of the punch that I desire. For me- I want it to be great sounding but also noticeably bass heavy. These Beats Studio buds deliver. The company recognizes that your not using these to analyze a song. These are for the people who like bass and want to feel some gravitas in their ears!—CONNECTIVITY—These connect effortlessly to iPhone, as if they were AirPods. It was the single biggest factor that blew me away with these. They are incredibly easy to connect. I cannot speak for android but these work great. They do not have a lot of audio adjustments like Bose but I frankly don’t need them to. You can easily see the battery state on both buds and the case from a pop up window in your apple home screen whenever opening the case, just like AirPods.—FIT—The fit is not as good as the raycon E55 but only by a little bit. They fit snuggly in your ears well enough that they do not fall off when running and working out. Although adjustments might need to be made to them occasionally. (I have small ears, so the fit is review as such)—THE CONTROLS—The controls are simple and straightforward. They are just like what you come to expect from earbuds. Single tap, double tap, triple tap.The earbuds HAVE AN ACTUAL BUTTON… which I thought was extinct, I personally hate the sensor buttons because adjusting your earbuds in your ears would trigger the controls.While these do have a very sensitive physical button— it is easy to avoid while adjusting with practice.—BATTERY—The battery lasts me all day, what more do you want?—RANGE—Very good, about 30+ feet—CONS—-no MagSafe compatible charging-fit isn’t as perfect as some brands but is really good-if your an audiophile these earbuds are not balancedFinal call-If you like bass, and hate the sensor controls on most earbuds— these very well could be the best earbuds you could get. These are on par with earbuds in the 200$ range. And if your anything like me, you will love them! And if not, they might still be worth it to you—UPDATE—they have a hard time staying in when working out, and so I had to buy wing tips for these. They automatically have active noise cancellation on when you take them out of the case… which I personally hate.And the cases battery is pretty short lived… only lasts two days generally",https://www.amazon.com/Beats-Studio-Cancelling-Earbuds-Built-Bluetooth-Headphones/product-reviews/B096SRYXMP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1

I bought the black ones because the pink ones weren't on sale.Let's start with some pros:The sound is very good, just about on par with my IEMs. These are definitely catered towards more bassy genres, but in the case of metal, I like being able to hear bass along side lead, and provides some heavy kicks. The physical button instead of just touch is an odd choice, but it works. The package comes with a free trial of Apple music (which I will never use), as well as a tiny usb-c to usb-c charger (so hopefully you have a spare usb-c block), and 3 different sized tips, small, meduim, and large. These have awareness mode, as well as a noise isolation mode. Awareness mode is nice, but noise isolation causes me to have a headache.Now some cons:This may be just my ears, but the small tip is too small, and the medium is just big enough to still be pushed out. The body is very smooth, and if you're someone that produces a lot of earwax (like me), it won't stay put and the only thing keeping it in is the tips, meaning you have to keep pushing them back in, and bumping the button. These sit in a very specific position, but don't really like to stay there. Because of the sound mostly being catered towards bass, some leads and vocals can sound a bit muddy at times. By default, the case doesn't have a loop for a string to hold on to and the case is very smooth, so you have to buy a third party case and put it over the stock case just to make it easier to hold on to. These come with an app, and it's very lackluster. No equalizer, there's a find earbuds feature but I'm pretty sure it's not GPS, and you can't mess with settings if the earbuds aren't connected, not to mention: why do my earbuds need to update?!In conclusion: these are good earbuds and I recommend them, but ONLY IF THEY'RE ON SALE.These are 100% worth the $75 I spent on them, but NO WAY ARE THEY WORTH THE $150 RETAIL PRICE TAG.",https://www.amazon.com/Beats-Studio-Cancelling-Earbuds-Built-Bluetooth-Headphones/product-reviews/B096SRYXMP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1

They’re small (good), not terribly obtrusive (only some out-of-ear-stick-out, tho your experience may vary), the sound has some solid bass which is helpful for the gym (where I tested these out), the sound overall is clear (download some equalizer apps to play with the sound itself), and they stayed in my ear well. I don’t know much about soundstage or whatever, but the sound itself is clear, bass is nice and strong, and you can hear even the subtle nuances like the shifting of a hand on guitar strings clearly enough without being disturbed. That, to me, is the sign of a good earbud.The transparency mode and noise canceling modes were alright. But that’s just it, they’re alright. Granted, the AirPod Pros have a higher price tag, so they do the ANC and Transparency mode much better. So it’s understandable that these would do the same, but on just the slightest bit of a lower level.I’m also spoiled bc the Airpod Pros have wireless charging. These DO have USB C, but the lack of wireless charging is a small thing, really. There’s something about being able to toss these on a charging pad and leaving them there to charge that’s just so satisfying. Also, was not a fan of how the case just doesn’t have that “premium” feel. The matte finish is nice, tho I would have liked a little more weight in the case lid, but at this point, these are such little (and I mean LITTLE) things that really, it’s not a dealbreaker.My only thing is the amount they stick out. I’m sorry, but they do look a little…funny, the way they sort of stick out just a bit so that the “b” logo is upright. They don’t stick out a LOT, but juuuuust enough that when you look in the mirror, you’ll see a vertical line where the physical button (which I have managed to press on accident a couple of times while adjusting the bud) sticks out. Also, I had a little difficulty getting them to stay in, but that’s beyond pretty much anyone’s control.These get that 4th star because of just how they are a solid enough product worth the purchase. They don’t do any one thing particularly well, but there are just enough teeny things for me that I wouldn’t say these are the best I’ve ever used. (For comparison, the Jabra 75t gets the equivalent of a 4.3 rating…the hear-through is amazing and their app really helps boost functionality).For me, these are SOLID gym earbuds. They play music loudly, clearly enough, and the bass is strong enough for me that I can drown out whatever annoying other music is playing outside. They fit and stay relatively well. For the price tag, you get some good bang for the buck. You could do worse, but at this range, depending on if you want to pitch in a few more, you could also do better.",https://www.amazon.com/Beats-Studio-Cancelling-Earbuds-Built-Bluetooth-Headphones/product-reviews/B096SRYXMP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1

It was lightweight, and pretty sleek, and it had a higher DPI screen.  It operated on the older carousel style interface, where my most recently accessed content was displayed first, regardless of what type of media (book, audio book, file transfered by email address). Every thing was pretty quick to load. I could organize into collections, but I didn't have to wait for each media section to load (because recently accessed stuff was front and center.  Then, Amazon started to keep up with other Android trends.  Everything became more like an app, with a sort of tabbed content for that type of media (book, audio book, music, ect.).  To open ebook, you have to activate the Kindle app icon, and wait for it to load.  Or, do the same thing with the Audible app.  Even on this new Fire, it can take several minutes for my music content to load, and come up on the screen.  I see the blue whirl of world wide wait ""loading"" more than I'd like.  Even with some of the shorter MP3 ""albums,"" like Metallica's Master of Puppets or Ride the Lightning, there can be quite a wait for it to load.  If I'm trying to load one of the large classical music sets, like 99 Mozart classics, snoozeville for the loading time.  For whatever reason, a lot of icons for my books are blank white, and not selectable.  Almost like the image cache is corrupt and needs to be recompiled.  And, I have a very good internet connection.  It's really frustrating, because the Kindle Fire was my first modern tablet device, and I loved that first one so much.  I think it was the last year Amazon produced the HDX model.  I like this tablet it's a big improvement over my 2016 midrange version  (I don't remember the name for that class).  It's a big improvement on my two 2019 basic $50 models that I sometimes pack around, and sometimes do...precarious...stuff with (I really can't play music on the 2016 or 2019 models anymore).  However, I just am not head-over-heels in love with it.  And, I really wanted to be that crazy about it.  It's a good device, for the price.  However, I'm underwhelmed with the ability to access my Amazon content on it, particularly when it comes to the ease, and speed of doing so.  I think a big part of the issue is treating each media type ecosystem as an app. Select the icon, and wait for that app interface to load.  Then, choose which item you want to open within that app. I think the previous carousel idea was much less convoluted.  I can't say it's a regrettable purchase, because I do have a substantial amount of Amazon digital content.  Amazon devices are all I've had, until fairly recently.  I just want to access my content more easily and quickly, without any drama.  Especially my bigger musical collections with 99 or more tracks.  Please, Amazon, do better.  I honestly think it can be done.",https://www.amazon.com/Amazon_Fire_HD_10/product-reviews/B0BHZT5S12/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1

Comparable units are either more expensive, have less clear screens and features, or are made of cheaper materials.  I recommend to make this a great product; a longer C cord and a protective Folio cover.  A c cord runs about $10 and folio $15-25.13 HR BATTERY LIFE:  *FAIL*  - can be solved with a new, longer C cord then it is VERY GOOD.2 new 64g tablets were bought for my kids just 2 weeks ago so they would have the best version with the most storage space.  The intended use is for entertainment and their school app.  I ensure they are charged fully daily, which takes a few hours.  They do about 1.5-2 hours on it before it dies from a fully drained battery.  They do not watch tv or Youtube on it, just access apps like school and a few game apps. This is a problem because they were bought because it said it has a 13-hour battery life, but it doesn't so I then have to have it spend 4 hours charging again so they can do more on it. This is an annoying big problem because we have to do school work on it that takes more than 1.5-2 hours in a day to do, which means they need to stop working on what homework they are doing and wait several hours to resume using it when the battery is recharged.  This doesn't do the job because of the poor battery life.  In the course of a day, the tablets each get charged 8 hours and get used under 4 hours if we don't use a longer cord and keep it plugged in during use.  Not a great thing if you need to use it on its own like it is intended or how the ad states you can for 13 hours.I did not care for fact I needed to get 10 ft C cords so it can stay charged while my kids used it.  The cord that comes with it is small, so much so that I can't plug it into a wall and have it rest on my desk.If you need this for games in the car, I recommend getting an auto charger with a very long C cord.If you need this to be charged more than 2 hours max, then get a very long C cord.  They make them in 10-foot range for like $10.IF you want to charge it then use it the next day, you need to turn it off first by powering down the unit. You cannot just turn the screen off to standby (not powering it down totally).  It will drain the unit.  Most tablets don't do this and actually have a longer standby battery life, which is why I mention this.  If you aren't gonna use it, just power it off is the point.PARENTAL CONTROLS:  *OK*I like the parental controls make it so kids cannot charge things on the tablet but even though I set it so they cannot download other game apps on it the tablet still allows them to.  Why add the feature and make us go thru the process of that setup if it doesn't work?  This is not a problem though because even if they download more game apps, they still can't charge any purchases.  I do have to go in there every few days to ensure I remove the ones I don't want them to have.  The directions how to setup the tablet for a child and block purchases, make account changes for the kids, and how to do things you want to is not clear at all.  I had to watch YouTube videos because instructions in and with the tablet were nonexistent or horribly unclear.GRAPHICS AND TOUCHSCREEN:  *VERY GOOD*The touchscreen is very responsive and the clarity is extremely clear for graphics.  It looks sharper than my 4k ultra HD TV and my Macbook.  I am very impressed with the graphics.SAFETY:The tablet is made less flexible than some, but still has a bit to it.  I would not own this tablet unless it was used with a protective cover you slide it into.  The one we have is very good and you can use it as a protective cover when closed or open and it props up too.  I very much recommend this case for this tablet.  It is made better than any other case I have tried.  It fits my iPad and my daughter's 10""kindle.  It is called a Fintie Folio Case for All-New Amazon Fire HD 10 and 10 Plus Tablet (13th/11th Generation, 2023/2021 Release) 10.1""",https://www.amazon.com/Amazon_Fire_HD_10/product-reviews/B0BHZT5S12/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1

My first one just died one day. Number two fell on a tiled floor and cracked the corner of the cover. It works fine but when I got an offer to get a small refund for buying a new one I thought it sounded like a good idea. It came yesterday and I spent all day downloading apps, updating passwords, emailing myself notes from the Notepad app so I could copy them into the new app (it doesn't sync when you get a new tablet). Then last night I turned the tablet off because the new one does not work with the charging platform number two works with even though I thought I was getting the same thing. Then a while later I wanted to look something up on the internet and when I turned it on it would not accept my security pin number which is required for viewing saved passwords on web browser. I tried over and over and finally contacted phone support. The tech was very patient and we worked on it for an hour. We got it to accept the pin once but couldn't get back in after that. He finally said we would have to do a factory reset. My phone was losing its charge by then so I told him I could probably handle it from there. This morning it was done reseting and my apps were all there. Of course all my passwords the browser had saved were gone and all my notes from Notepad. I'll work on reseting them some other day. What really frustrates me is how sluggish the typing response is. It skips letters sometimes and when touching the page to turn it on the Kindle app it does not respond. My old Fire tablet, number two, works much faster. And there is a notification on my home page that I can clear. It says ""NEO delegate"". The tech didn't know what this is and could not clear it either. I wasn't going to add the security pin number afyer all the trouble we had last night but I was trying to set up a backup email account for gmail and needed to see the password I chose yesterday. You can't see the letters if you don't have the security pin number, so I entered it and hope it won't lock me out again in the future.Each time I have replaced  a Kindle or a Fire tablet in the past the new one was an upgrade. This Fire tablet is definitely not. I have sent my old one, number two, in for the refund that was offered and I tempted to just send this one back. I'm so fed up with it at the mom I'm not sure I can make a good decision so I'll give it another day. I deleted apps from tablet number two as I downloaded them to number three thinking I would be sending it in for the small refund so it has none of my apps or passwords on it and I'd have to download them all again. I just want to cry. Apple I-pad is sounding better every day. There is one for about the same price I paid for this one. I would not rec this model of Fire tablet.Update: After spending another hour on the phone with customer support we agreed it would be best to send this tablet back.  I cancelled the replacement tablet because I no longer trust this product.",https://www.amazon.com/Amazon_Fire_HD_10/product-reviews/B0BHZT5S12/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1

I put it away for vacation, and it wouldn't charge or turn on when I returned. I tried everything, including talking with Amazon support, all to no avail. The customer service rep did tell me about trading in the device for a new one, with a discount. That worked out very well, and I got a great deal.Now to my issues: it was hard to reproduce all my programs from my old tablet. I had to try 6 Spider Solitaires to get the one back I was used to. I can't get rid of Amazon Kids off the front page. My email that comes through the internet doesn't display the same, and I can't delete things without scrolling through pages to get to the bottom to see the delete key. There's no way to make that tool bar stay on the page. Every time I come back into the internet, it makes me refresh the page. The old tablet did none of these things. I had another talk with customer service, and the rep scrolled through my tablet with me (very helpful), but the final answer was Amazon did an upgrade, and all the rep could do was bring my customer complaint to management's attention. Also, there is no user manual (except the Hello pamphlet), and no one ever answers my questions on the user forums.If the email thing doesn't get fixed soon, I will slowly use this tablet less, and default to my laptop. It's great to play my Spider solitaire, see my other email, and read the paper, but having my primary email be uncooperative is a breaking point for me.",https://www.amazon.com/Amazon_Fire_HD_10/product-reviews/B0BHZT5S12/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1
Unknown,R277MDI3ZU7O0A,Critical,"Amazon Fire HD 10 tablet (newest model) built for relaxation, 10.1"" vibrant Full HD screen, octa-core processor, 3 GB RAM, 32 GB, Black",4.5,2.0,"15,519","I have purchased 6 Fire tablets over the years. They have all been reliable workhorses and excellent devices for movies, music and media. I have used my Fire 8 for heavy work research and extremely active social media and blog posting. No, you can't use these devices to edit films or create graphic art like iPads, but you get a ridiculously great value for top notch media consumption and reliable performance for all web browsing.Until now.I am so disappointed in this version of the Fire tablet.  The audio is substantially worse than previous versions, including audio from plugged in headphones and earbuds, not just the device speaker.The performance SUCKS. I've had my device for only one day and I've had to reboot 6 times because Audible freezes and won't play. Audible!? Audible is a standard Amazon app that should be fairly bulletproof at this point in Fire tablet history.I also really dislike the new nightshade filter. The almost orange-brown hue of previous tablets actually worked to block blue light. Many of us with light sensitivity issues appreciated that old filter. Yes, it made the screen orange, but it also REALLY prevented eye strain. The new tablet is vaguely amber, similar to the Iphone night shade, and does nothing for my sensitive eyes, even when turned up to the max level.  Others likely find the new night shade appearance an improvement over the former orange screen, but I miss how soothing it was.The new Fire also has terrible connection to WiFi.  Nothing in my house has changed but unlike previous tablets this one can't stay connected.  I even sat right next to my WiFi hub, and the device kept dropping connection.I've noticed a lag when typing, too, that no other tablet had.If you have never owned be previous Fire tablst you might not notice the changes, but if you've loved your previous versions, dont get this ""upgrade.""UPDATE:It is not just my Fire 10 device.  I spoke with 2 friends who ""upgraded"" -- one for their children and one for an older mom.  The speakers and internal audio on all devices are USELESS.  Kids can't hear movies in the car and barely in quiet room unless right up against speaker. No headphones or ear buds can be turned up loud enough.  My friend's older mom with audiology-measured MILD hearing loss (no hearing aid required) can't understand language unless holding device speaker up to her ear, which negates how she wanted to use it for Alexa, Zoom calls and YouTube recipes in the kitchen.I still have a functional Fire 7. The speaker can be heard in the next room. The 8 I still have in my office is great for music and videos. Not as good as the 7, but still functional. Both Re on par with my iphone 14 and gaGalaxy phone speakers. To use the Fire 10 I and the two others I know with this version have to connect to external bluetooth speakers.Amazon devices keep getting shortchanged from their original offerings. My daughter's 7 year old regular kindle has better text visibility than my new one.  How much profit is enough, Amazon?The other bugs in the 10 continue to frustrate me. Audible  won't consistently work, the device crashes, text input often lags.Get the 8 instead! And hopefully Fire's next iteration won't suck.UPDATE May 19, 2024Ok, after numerous complaints,about the horrible audio from other friends, one suggested downloading a speaker booster app from the Amazon app store. Another one used an APK mirror site to download an Android equalizer/volume booster.  I chose the highest rated Amazon app store app. I can now hear everything perfectly through both both external speaker and headphones, equalling and even excelling the audio performance of the Fire 7 which has always been superior to subsequent models.  This tells me it is not a hardware issue but rather volume throttling in the Fire OS. WHY?!!!???My Audible app started working fine after the latest OS update last week, but keyboard lag and WiFi drop are still problems -- ones I have not had with my previous Fire tablets. Regarding WiFi, Amazon PLEASE allow Ethernet connection for future tablets!Anyway, a free app solved volume issues for me and several others, and OS update fixed Audible . At least I can use the tablet for audiobooks, music and movies now. Keyboard lag is still too irritating to use consistently for writing, web searching, social media, etc. YMMV.UPDATE July 12, 2024RIP crappy Fire tablet 10!  After a week of weird bugs—notifications I couldn’t dismiss, inability to open Audible books, inability to open library books in Libby, inability to open Kindle books, inability to play Prime videos, crashing Safari, freezing videos on Netflix, etc, etc, etc—I decided to do a factory reset and restore to backup.Guess what? I have been waiting 2 hours for the backup to restore. It is still at 0%. I GIVE UP.This is the WORST version of Fire tablet. Of my friends previously mentioned, 2 also had critical failures with their tablets that were similar to mine, and earlier than it happened to me.  I am so bummed out because I have loved all the other, now-obsolete Fire tablets.Several people have mentioned this on Amazon forums, and apparently the last OS update at the end of June is buggy, but now I have a brick and can’t even wait for the patch.",https://www.amazon.com/Amazon_Fire_HD_10/product-reviews/B0BHZT5S12/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1

But this one had to have much better sound (as the other 2 Fires did not). I have had this tablet for under a week and on the first day I noticed, in the upper left corner with the time an app that said “NEO Delegate” and one other message.  For a brand new tables just a day or so old that should not be! So, I called Amazon for help to have these messages REMOVED. I called TWICE (2ce) the first cs person got rid of one of them but this “NEO Delegate” popped up again. So, I called back and the second cs person could not get rid of it, I suggested she get some help to do this as she could not fix this error in this tablet  She told me it was not bothering the working of the tablet ( I guess she did not know HOW to fix this error) she  also became irritated.  I explained to her I just purchased this Tablet, but she really did not want to be bothered.I am a Prime Member, which as we all know is not cheap and I also purchase Music Unlimited, also not cheap, but this does not bother Amazon and this is exactly the kind of treatment which looses customers.

They have a real sustainability problem and die before having them 3 years. Luckily it's not too expensive or I wouldn't bother. I'm already having to have this tablet replaced after less than a week, but Amazon's customer service was very helpful with it. Here's my thoughts in no particular order.1. Like the lilac color & that the covers have a translucent back.2. This tablet is nearly an 1"" smaller than my previous Kindle. Don't have a clue why, especially when tablets are now trending to 11"" because of the OS. Feels heavier, too.3. Because of the good deal on the 64MB, I purchased that and - finally - Kindle makes a bit more sense. With all of the bloatware you can't get rid of, especially the kid stuff when there is no kid in the house, I literally could only download a handful of apps. I can download so much more and still have room!4. The On/Off button has been moved to the left side. I don't get this. With the majority of people being right-handed, I don't understand why it was moved to where you have to reach across the tablet...especially if you want to take a screenshot.5. If you want to use the camera on the back, you'll have to remove the tablet from the cover. I can't recall where the camera was on the previous tablet because I didn't have a cover for it. Now, the lens is on the same side as the On/Off, which means when you fold back the cover, the lens is covered up! Who in the world didn't test this? The point of a cover is to make it easier to handle & provide some protection and in an action that literally is the riskiest move to make w/a tablet, Amazon has rendered either the camera useless, or the cover. I'd really like to know what they were thinking on this one.6. Battery life: Not good at all. Like I said, I've had 3 previous tablets - one 7"" and 2 10"" - and there's been a definite trend downward on battery life. I'm on it for several hours cumulative per day - playing a few apps, reading, ""X""...and I have to recharge at least once a day. It also feels like it takes a lot longer to charge than my previous tablet. I've had this plugged in for about 40 mins and it's gone from 13% to 28%. That's not great.7. A lot of apps are not longer viable. I don't think this is an issue with Amazon, just an issue with the new OS and developers not keeping up, so I'm guessing a lot of new tablets are having the same issues. Kinda sad. Some of these apps I've been playing for years and years!8. It took 10 days to arrive. I could have ordered some weird brand tablet and have it delivered literally that afternoon so I'm truly befuddled as to why ""2-day Delivery"" Amazon would force Fire purchasers to sit on their hands for that long. My tablet was in ""Order"" mode up until the evening before it was scheduled to be delivered. Why? We have a distribution center very near so...My mom has a Fire 10, I think 12th Gen, so I'll check this against hers, especially w/charging. Also, since my tablet appears to be defective, if this changes with the replacement, I'll update the review.  Again, this is just my thoughts on it and those things that bug me may not bug you!UPDATE: Amazon being Amazon. They lied. They won't ship it until Monday. So much for a responsive Customer Service.

I already have a kindle paperwhite, so didn’t really need this, but really enjoy this game while I am at chemotherapy for hours or waiting in doctor’s offices. It’s a good distraction. I didn’t realize it’s not connected to the Google Play Store. When I downloaded the Monopoly Go game, I discovered that there is no link to send to others to trade stickers or to connect and play with friends. That is the main point of the game for me! I tried to use the 2 methods it showed to add contacts because there was no link to send others like there is on a phone (my phone is too old, hence the kindle purchase). I sent to all contacts (yellow button with white phone) inputting my phone number multiple times and no one received the invite that lives in my home, or that I know including a chemo friend while we were both there and sitting side by side for a few hours each week after multiple attempts. I tried multiple times with other friends & at home with family also. I messaged support and they told me to connect to Facebook. I opened a Facebook account and sent friend requests. No link possible there either, no friends received requests even when I made a second Facebook account on a separate borrowed device, logged into MoGo and tried the process again. I messaged Scopely/MoGo support 3 times after installing FB, and they basically told me they already answered this, don’t message again. I googled this and it’s a common problem. I wish Amazon would fix this with Scopely because it made playing pointless. If I can’t trade stickers, I can’t finish the albums. Overall, I wouldn’t repurchase this. I would buy a cheaper tablet with access to the Google Play store. The touch screen can’t be adjusted and my touch is not working constantly as well, but I am losing my fingerprints due to cancer treatments, so I don’t know if that is a common issue. It’s hard to toggle between apps because you can only use an arrow at the bottom and that closes the apps I am trying to toggle between. The battery life is good. It’s a bit slower than my phone and doesn’t pick up wifi as well. The appearance is nice, seems high tech when looking at it. It does stream well from Hulu and Prime. Readability is nice, but I wish I could lower the brightness more at night.",https://www.amazon.com/Amazon_Fire_HD_10/product-reviews/B0BHZT5S12/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1

With the sale price and credit for my trade in, it was a great deal.Cons: the touch screen is not very responsive. I often have to close a page because it won't respond to taps. Maybe it's doing something in the background that I'm not aware of, but nothing else is open and it just locks up. If I go back, then reopen the page sometimes it will work, but it's very annoying.The operating button placement is also annoying. The on\off button is right next to the volume buttons on the top left of the device, making it very easy to accidentally turn the device off while trying to turn the volume down.I read a lot so use the Kindle library. The library screen is baffling. If I download a loaned book, it doesn't appear in my ""continue reading"" column unless I immediately open it to the first page. However, every single book that I have finished reading and returned already stays in that column. Forever, apparently. I've even gone to the ""manage my content"" page and deleted the downloads but, voila! Open the screen and there they are again. But the ones I wanted to read next?

For that purpose, the tablet serves pretty well. It's fast enough, can purchase directly from the Kindle store, and has expandable memory. If you're interested in also using third party comics subscription apps like DC Universe Infinite or Marvel Unlimited, however, you're not going to be happy. The locked down nature of the Kindle Fire HD 10 means you cannot install those apps without jumping through some hoops that I don't personally consider worth the effort.  Comixology Unlimited has a lot to offer, so it's not entirely a deal breaker, but this limitation can keep the Kindle from being your primary tablet for digital comics if you're a a subscriber to those other services. Three stars for its functionality. However...The Fire HD 10 is a cheaply made tablet. I knew that going in, but I didn't expect it to fail on me within a week of my purchase. After less than a week of ownership, I went to use it one day and as soon as I unlocked it, the screen rapidly faded to black and became unresponsive. I could occasionally wake it up, but the fade to black would still happen, which made it essentially useless for reading or watching anything. Occasionally it would mix it up and fade to a bright white, but in every case the tablet was useless. I tried to RMA for an exchange, but the automated system claimed that the HD 10 was sold to me by a third party seller (not the case) and that I would need to send it back, have a refund issued, and then buy another if I wanted. Having not had time to ship it back to Amazon, I experimented with it over the course of the next few days and was able to stabilize it with some percussive maintenance and made the decision to hold onto it.So what's WRONG with the HD 10? It's cheaply made. If the casing flexes in the right (wrong) way in your bag, presumably some connections become flakey and it affects the functionality of the display. If you're dead set on buying this tablet, I recommend a nice rigid case to protect it, because at the end of the day it's a bit fragile. I certainly didn't beat mine up, it simply couldn't handle a couple of bike commutes in a messenger bag. If you're okay with being soft locked into Comixology/Kindle and are okay with putting it into a heavier-duty case then I think this is a nice tablet for the price when you can pick it up on sale.",https://www.amazon.com/Amazon_Fire_HD_10/product-reviews/B0BHZT5S12/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1

My husband gets my hand-me-downs, and since had I just bought a new 10"" tablet back in February (ocean), he now gets that one and I get the new one (lilac). So we're both happy. We mostly use our tablets for reading, and for that purpose, they work great. This 10-inch tablet is a nice size, not too heavy for reading or browsing the internet. Overall, it is a nice looking tablet at a good price and does what I need it to do. That being said, there are some limitations:1) I'm not much of a gamer, but some years back, I got a few games for free on a Black Friday sale and enjoyed playing them. I also downloaded another game that is free to play. All three of these games worked great until I got to end-game. I then had problems with the game slowing down and even freezing to the point where I was unable to play them to the finish. I tried adding extra storage, even going so far as buying a newer tablet, but ultimately realized that it was a RAM issue. It's disappointing to me that games would be sold in the Amazon Appstore when the RAM on the tablet wouldn't be able to support the demands of the game. There is an upside: I stopped playing them and now have more time to read, yay!2) Even though my tablet is new, it is becoming more and more apparent that Amazon is no longer supporting some of its own apps. These apps are no longer working (although the sites themselves can still be accessed using the Silk Browser): Goodreads, which Amazon owns, so this is really a mystery, especially because so many people do use their tablets for reading; and both the Shop Amazon and the Photos app now take you to the Silk Browser, where you need to sign in each time to access. In the case of the Photos app, it seems to have been replaced with the new Gallery app, but as of this date, Gallery is extremely limited in function. To use a new photo wallpaper, for example, I had to click on the Photos app, sign in, find and download locally the picture I wanted to use, and only then could the innate wallpaper chooser ""see"" the photo, which was also then available in Gallery. Whew! Prior to this change, the wallpaper could be easily changed in one step, as Amazon Photos was one of the choices, along with the built-in wallpapers, and you could scroll and select a photo as desired.If you're not an end-gamer or don't really need or rely on the built-in Amazon apps, you'll be fine, as this is still a more than decent tablet for the price.",https://www.amazon.com/Amazon_Fire_HD_10/product-reviews/B0BHZT5S12/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1

I think I buy at least one new one every 2 years, if not yearly.  The price is right, especially during Prime Day or Black Friday sales, so why not?  The ""old"" ones then become upgrades for my parent's tablets -- or they get used as a touch-screen interface to a music system or home automation system, or they upgrade the *really* old ones that eventually become too slow or are no longer supported.  I have a few tablets I designate for use when I'm outside grilling or partying and don't mind getting beat up a bit.These 10in tablets are a nice size for when you want a bigger screen.  We've used them on Zoom calls with relatives and it's nice not having to listen to the noise of a laptop fan spinning up and down while video conferencing.  I've used them with some cloud gaming services and once again, it's awesome not having to hear a fan like you usually would when playing games on a laptop or PC.  I've also used these tablets to connect remotely to my desktop.  Paired with a bluetooth mouse and keyboard you can essentially use the tablet as a ""thin client"" to connect to a more powerful PC and the battery lasts a lot longer than a normal laptop battery would.  I've used some drawing applications on them too, where even if you just use your finger and pinch-zoom to magnify, you can actually create some pretty nice drawings if you're artistic.The world of apps and usefulness of Kindle tablets really opens up if you side-load Google Play Store.  I like Tinycam for viewing wireless pet cameras, SuperDisplay and EasyCanvas for a lag free display for Windows, Squeezer for remote control of Squeezebox music system, Pinball Arcade for pretty authentic pinball experience, Microsoft Remote Desktop to connect to Windows desktops, NoMachine to connect to Mac Mini lag free, Steam Link & a bluetooth Xbox controller to remote play games from my desktop, Touch Portal (powerful remote macro control deck like Steam Deck), Sketchbook for intuitive drawing, Squid for note taking and brainstorming ideas, SimpleMind for quick mind maps, Engross for todo lists, Habits for easy habit tracking, MyRadar for viewing live weather radar & the list goes on!  Again, only after installing Play Store do you open up that world of possibilities, otherwise you are limited to what's on the Amazon App Store.  If you're a bit technical it's not hard to figure out.My wife and I love our Kindle Tablets and this 10in tablet is was the newest member of the group.  We've had very few issues with any of the tablets we've bought over the years, aside from some of the normal things that happen after you've installed dozens and dozens of apps and at some point have to wipe the tablet to clear it out and speed it up.  But no hardware issues to speak of really.  They've just ""worked"" and have been pretty rock-solid.  Unless they become more expensive, or quality changes, we'll continue buying Kindle tablets in the future.",https://www.amazon.com/Amazon_Fire_HD_10/product-reviews/B0BHZT5S12/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1

I've had it now a month and being disabled, I have been using it faithfully every day for many many hours per day. Since I've never had a tablet before I can't really compare it to another.But, there are a couple of issues I have been having and don't know if this is normal behavior for a tablet or not.First issue that is really bothered to me is that after watching a lot of videos from streaming most of the day that suddenly the videos start getting ""choppy."" This means that I'll be watching a video and it hits a snag and stalls briefly and then starts up and continues to do this nonstop.  It gets so irritating that I have to stop watching videos completely and turn the tablet off.  No, this isn't a WiFi buffer issue.  I have a similar issue with my flat screen TV because it's not a Smart TV, and it's older.  With the TV, though, I'm lucky if I can watch more than a movie before the subtitles go off sync with the video and have to restart.  I'm suspecting that the video stalling issue might be other than the tablet, but don't know for sure.  But, I'll have watched videos most of a day before this stalling starts to happen.  Since I can't be certain if the issue is with the tablet and not the streaming service, I give the benefit to the tablet.The second issue is with the video selection on the tablet.  I'll have the screen with a bunch of squares of different videos to select from and when I select one on the screen, it responds by opening up something completely different that is on a different part of the screen.  Again, I don't know if this is a tablet issue for sure, but it is a little annoying when I'm trying to decide on what I want to watch next and something else pops up that I didn't select.  Also, when I'm watching a video, the tablet doesn't respond always when I touch it to pause it.  Again, don't know if this is a tablet issue or not.BUT, I love both the video and audio quality of the tablet.  I got the tablet for the purpose of watching my streaming videos and it's been a wonderful experience.  One thing that really pleasantly surprised me was the audio!!  Absolutely fantastic!  It's like having surround sound when watching videos!I got the case to go with the tablet as well and it's really nice.  It took me a bit to adjust to the case in maneuvering it in my bed when laying down, but it's satisfactory.  After all, these things aren't really designed with the disabled in mind.  But, it is a nice quality case cover for the tablet.  I have a few cats, so the case cover protects it very nicely against their tendencies to lay atop the tablet.  It's a good protection for falling off the bed when I've fallen asleep!So, for my first experience with a tablet, this is great.  Makes me wonder what took me so long to buy one!",https://www.amazon.com/Amazon_Fire_HD_10/product-reviews/B0BHZT5S12/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1

A few days before my trip, I went to download content on my Fire HD10 9th generation (2019 release) tablet but it would not start. I disassembled it and found the battery fully charged but the power distribution chip was toast! Finding no way to get it repaired locally, I ordered another one February 6th which, before I added it to my cart and before I completed my purchase, was promised overnight shipping. The new tablet was to arrive Wednesday, February 7th by 11am. After completing my purchase I noticed this had been changed to just sometime on February 7th. I looked at my orders around 3:30 pm February 7th and discovered arrival was now February 9th! I called customer service, gave them the what for, was transferred to Amazon shipping, gave them the what for also, even offered to drive down to the distribution center and pick it up myself! I was left with little hope of getting my new tablet before my trip. Then at 9 pm, a knock at my door, someone had come through!The Fire HD 10 13th generation (2023 release) has a vastly different x:y dimension than the 9th generation (2019 release). I had to order a new case but I like the new form factor better.The Fire HD 10 13th  (2023 release) collects a lot more dirt in the groove between its glass front and plastic backing than did either my HD 10 9th generation (2019 release) or my HDX 7 before it. I'm constantly trying to get it out with my thumbnails!The power button is in the wrong place on the 13th generation (2023 release). 9 times out of 10 when I go to turn up the volume, I end up turning it off!""Do what you love, uninterrupted""...but only if you can find the secret to recharging faster than 5 to 9 hours! The Fire HD 10 13th generation says it's native Amazon 9W charger, depending on starting battery level, takes ~5 hours to fully recharge. That's way too long to wait if you're wanting to use your tablet! Read on and I'll tell you how to access 15W USB-C charging that only takes ~2 hours!I read Fire tablets with USB-C charging ports are capable of up to 15W charging. I did not want to buy a 15W charger (fire hazard) from one of the many 6 UPPERCASE CHARACTER named Chinese companies offering them here on Amazon. I have other charges from a prominent brand here on Amazon, some claiming PD 3.0, offering up to 5V4.8A, and rated up to 60W, that were taking anywhere from 5 to 9 hours. Why didn't these work? What's the secret to 15W Charging?Well, I found it! Fire tablets with USB-C charging ports, at least the 13th generation (2023 release) HD 10, use the PD PPS protocol to negotiate 15W charging. But why didn't my existing name brand chargers provide 15W? There's more detail on that below.You need a charger with PD 3.0 PPS or PD 3.1 (that's guaranteed to have PPS) to get 15W charging. If a manufacturer claims PD 3.0 but fails to mention PPS in the product description, use the ""Looking for specific info?"" box to ""Search in reviews, Q&A..."" for ""PPS"". You need at least 3A in whatever PD PPS voltage output range contains 5V.Details:The Fire HD 10 uses an order of precedence when negotiating a charging solution with a charger, first attempting PD negotiation then ultimately dropping back to basic USB Type C charging when PD negotiation fails. Basic USB Type C charging power drops off dramatically during charging leading to 5 to 9 hour charging times whereas PD PPS power stays fairly close to 15W the entire time. 15W PD PPS charging should really only take ~2 hours from ~10% to full or you've been taken!Some 6 UPPERCASE CHARACTER named Chinese companies are offering 5V3A 15W USB-A chargers using a USB-A to USB-C cable with integrated 56 ohm resistor to emulate a USB-C to USB-C cable. Sorry, these may be able to provide the requisite 15W but USB PD is just not available from a USB-A charger port. Some 6 UPPERCASE CHARACTER named Chinese companies offer 5V3A 15W USB-C chargers using USB-C to USB-C cables that don't offer USB PD protocol. I have a handful of older chargers of these types from a reputable charger manufacturer and one does provide more power initially (11.5W) than the native 9W Amazon charger but basic USB Type C charging starts at lower power than true USB PD charging and drops off rapidly. I've seen the Fire HD 10 reported anywhere from 5 to 9 hours until fully charged for these basic USB Type C chargers.USB Power Delivery (PD) 1.0 was released July, 2012. With the USB PD 1.0 you get six fixed power profiles for different device categories 5V2A, 12V1.5A, 12V3A, 12V5A, 20V,3A, and 20V5A.The USB Power Delivery 2.0 fast charging standard was released August, 2014. With the USB PD 2.0, you got (fixed) voltages 5V3A, 9V3A, 12V3A, 15V3A, and 20V5A.The USB Power Delivery 3.0 fast-charging standard was released November, 2015. USB PD 3.0 made functional improvements but did not present (voltage) differences compared to USB PD 2.0, you still got (fixed) voltages 5V3A, 9V3A, 12V3A, 15V3A, and 20V5A.The USB Power Delivery 3.0 PPS fast-charging standard was released February, 2017. This version adds a programmable power supply (PPS) that can realize voltage and current regulation using USB PD protocol output. In addition to USB PD 2.0 and USB PD 3.0 fixed voltages, USB PD 3.0 PPS has specific PPS voltages, which are 3.3V-5.9V 3A, 3.3-11V 3A, 3.3-16V 3A, and 3.3-21V 3A, 3.3-21V 5A (100W Max).The USB Power Delivery 3.1 fast-charging standard was released May, 2021. In addition to USB PD 2.0 and USB PD 3.0 fixed voltages and USB PD 3.0 PPS programmable voltages, USB PD 3.1 adds 15V-28V 5A, 15V-36V 5A, and 15V-48V 5A (240W Max).From a prominent charger manufacturer's website:Power IQ 1.0: Supports 5V/2.4A maxPower IQ 2.0: Compatible with QC 3.0 + Power IQ 1.0Power IQ 3.0: Compatible with QC 3.0 + PD 3.0 + Power IQ 1.0Power IQ 4.0: Compatible with QC 3.0 + PD 3.0 + Power IQ 1.0 + Dynamic Power DistributionBecause of the way Power Delivery specifications were released, a manufacturer can legitimately claim PD 3.0 support without supporting PPS needed for 15W charging Amazon USB-C tablets.I have a 45W output charger from a reputable charger manufacture that my FNIRSI FNB58 says supports USB PD 3.0 PDO:4. The 4 PD output profiles are 5V ⎓ 2.4A / 9V ⎓ 3A / 15V ⎓ 3A / 20V ⎓ 2.25A.  I see the Fire HD 10 briefly (about 1 second) hit 12.4W while attempting PD negotiation before dropping back to 9W basic USB Type C charging when PD negotiation fails. The Fire HD 10 reports 5 hours until fully charged.I have another 60W output charger from a reputable charger manufacture that my FNIRSI FNB58 says supports USB PD 2.0 PDO:4. The 4 PD output profiles are 5V ⎓ 3A / 9V ⎓ 3A / 15V ⎓ 3A / 20V ⎓ 3A. My FNIRSI FNB58 says the Fire HD 10 negotiates PD 1.0 14W but it seems unable to decode the device categories used by PD 1.0. It makes no sense but the Fire HD 10 reported 2 hours until fully charged for this apparently non-PPS charger.

My upgrade to this 10.1"" tablet was a good choice. I got it on sale,  and it was well worth the difference. The larger screen brings a better viewing experience  I really appreciate the fact that it supports SD cards Tip: although I had no problem using an SD card that I transferred video, audio, and other stuff onto from my computer, apparently some people DID have trouble. This tablet can format a card so that it can be used to transfer files.Using this tablet, I can get the streaming services to which I subscribe - and I can take them with me as long as I have access to WiFi. I watch videos from the SD card almost daily.This ISN'T an iPad -- the screen may not be as sharp as Apple's much more expensive tablet -- but for my purposes, it works well.I don't use my Fire tablet for browsing the Internet - theoretically, I can. Although I haven't  attached a bluetooth keyboard or Bluetooth mouse, I can conceivably use this tablet for browsing.Applications come from Amazon's app store, so the number of apps may  be lower than Google's app store (there are ways to enable the tablet to use Google Store apps - I haven't tried this, and won't explain how this is done).The model I got was ad based. When you start the tablet, you'll see an ad - often for a 'game' that will end up costing money to play. So far, this hasn't bothered me enough to fork over the $15 (or so) that Amazon charges to disable the ads.This tablet has less memory than my old 8"" Fire Pro - but so far, this hasn't been a bit of a problem. I haven't tried recording downloads onto my SD card, although I think this is supported.For the price and convenience, I'm quite pleased with this device.",https://www.amazon.com/Amazon_Fire_HD_10/product-reviews/B0BHZT5S12/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1

Most have stood the test of time. The dots. The Show 5s. The previous version of the Show 8. Which brings me to write this review comparing the previous Show 8 to the 2023 Show 8:Sound- In spite of marketing positioning, the audio output of the previous version sounds better to me. Much better. The ""spatial audio"" is mostly spacey audio, with lower overall audio performance and quality than the previous version.User interface- Probably 'cause I'm one of those pesky I.T. people, I enjoy the ability to set up a unit with my personal preferences. The previous Show 8 version allowed me the flexibility to configure it. The 2023 version takes a more Apple-like approach. Limiting the users ability to set personal preferences, like even the clock face and the wallpaper.Microphone- All my other Echo and Echo Show devices can hear, understand, and respond fairly quickly to my verbal commands. The 2023 unit has a major hearing disability. I must literally shout at the unit from just a few feet away or be very close for it to hear me. According to Amazon's AI assistant, this is a known issue.In summary, the 2023 Echo Show 8 is a major disappoint to me.

Unknown,RBD847G323AYE,Critical,"Amazon Echo Show 8 (3rd Gen, 2023 release) | With Spatial Audio, Smart Home Hub, and Alexa | Charcoal",4.5,3.0,"13,840","I was hesitant to get an Alexa device for years because of it's reputation for listening in on all conversations and then showing ads within hours pertaining to things mentioned aloud within earshot of Alexa. But, I was eager to try the Echo Show because I heard great things about its video quality.The video resolution is excellent, and so is the sound quality. My favorite ""skill,"" as Alexa likes to call them -- or ""app"" as the rest of the world refers to them -- is Ambient Visions. That program streams videos for things like coral reefs, fish tanks, waterfalls, campfires -- all with natural sounds. Options also exist for light music, too.Every time it plays, Ambient Visions features an ad constantly scrolling along the bottom encouraging users to pay for a monthly subscription to eliminate ads. The free version also limits videos to one hour before you have to restart the video or select a new one.However, I found the one-hour timer is ideal for getting work done in short sprints. I love being able to turn on a video and work on a project for exactly one hour.One of the biggest downfalls to Alexa in particular is that it's hard to learn what skills are available. I found a few lists on the internet, but almost all of them require an add-on subscription.When first starting the Echo device, it comes with literally dozens of options turned on by default. That meant whatever I was doing was constantly interrupted with new notifications.Perhaps the most annoying aspect of the Echo device is that it is CONSTANTLY displaying new ads for Amazon products and services at the rate of one every 15 seconds.As I am writing this, it shows one scenic photo, followed by an ad for hair color (I'm bald), followed by an ad for contemporary dance ensemble, followed by an Amazon Music suggestion (subscription required, of course), followed by a Amazon video recommendation, followed by a sampling of recently used skills and, finally, another scenic photo.The bottom line for me is having the one-hour timer for Ambient Visions has been a great way to increase my productivity, so I'll keep the Echo device. But, unless Ambient Visions is playing a video, I must literally  shut down the device to shop seeing the stream of ad content. In that regard, it's kind of silly to pay for a device that streams ads to buy more stuff.",https://www.amazon.com/All-New-Echo-Show-8/product-reviews/B0BLS3Y632/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1

I was expecting significant improvements in the functionality as well as the responsiveness of the touch screen.  Neither have been addressed in this product.  Let’s start with functionality…The product is designed to show advertising.  I get that Amazon is selling this on prime day at a price point that may be less then what it normally should be, but honestly I would pay a higher price to not have any advertisements.  There is very little you can control on how the unit displays things.  You get a random song you recently played on Spotify and the next screen refresh it shows you a Yahoo news article about the stock market and the next screen it tries to sell you a surface pro laptop which I have zero interest in since we are an Apple home.  Also, there is no control over which news networks so we will get propaganda stories pushed to us from Fox News and no way to tell Alexa to block those stories.What I was hoping for was a customizable screen to control all my smart home devices.  There is a button on the Home Screen for this and it loads your “favorites” but there is no real way to customize the order and you can only have like 4 of them on there.So, really this is just a smart speaker that controls Alexa and displays random advertisements, with the news and the weather and a few other things peppered in.  The lack of control is very disappointing.The touch screen has “ok” responsiveness.  Drag down with your finger and click the home button to go back to the main Home Screen.  It’s not any more responsive to then the first generation Echo Show.

I love the fact that I can teach it skills and create highly customized routines. But it is like people sitting in three different worlds wrote the interface. I can say something one day and it does exactly what I want. The next day I say it the same way but it has no idea what I'm talking about.I love the Sugarmate skill because it will tell me my blood glucose from Dexcom when I don't have my phone near me.I think they wasted a lot of time with skills based around sophomores sounds. Saw the routines around coughing are brilliant. It seems like the Alexa team is struggling to find real life application for some of the capabilities of product family has.I have a routine that automatically plays my church service on Sunday mornings at 8:30 a.m. It's using the exact same routine that has not been changed. It starts off by setting the volume level then it searches a table for the URL of the website. It even has a WAIT command which allows it to not get interrupted by other functions for the hour and 30 minutes that we're having service.CMost weeks it works fine. Then one week it will start talking about something called Hey Vickie and doesn't work at all. I suspect Vickie is in there somewhere, but Alexa says itdoesn't recognize it at all. Everything about the routine is exactly the same as the previous week! It is the weirdest, quirkiest thing I've ever seen.Bing Open Web is the same way. The same exact set of instructions yield different results from day to day. It's the only place on a computer I have ever seen this.I have a routine that plays sleep sounds using Ambient Visions. Once ambient visions opens, Alexa will no longer accept commands unless you say, Alexa, Go home, first. Even Alexa's voice is different once my sleep sounds routine commences.I have a fubotv subscription but the show devices will not run the fubotv app. It starts going into Adobe and will not work.I love the speaker on the device.

Unknown,R3RAG66WHY5XYU,Critical,"Amazon Echo Show 8 (3rd Gen, 2023 release) | With Spatial Audio, Smart Home Hub, and Alexa | Charcoal",4.5,3.0,"13,840","Let me begin by saying that the Echo Show 8 is an amazing device for $90.  It's got a fabulous screen, very good audio, and it's useful for many tasks.  But here's the rub--it's not very good at the task for which I bought it.My brother recently lost most of his sight as a result of a surgical accident.  That has been devastating of course--particularly as he has always been a voracious reader.  To help him compensate, I bought the echo to allow him to listen to Kindle books via the text-to-speech option.  Here's where the device is only average.First, given that AI's can now compose creditable poetry and carry on therapeutic conversations with people, Alexa seems to be the slow child in the AI playground.  With effort, Alexa can find a title on the Kindle and be induced to start reading.  And the text-to-function works well.  Alexa (or Kindle) does a better job reading than some of the Audible books I've listened to!!  But it's not easy.  Some of the simplest tasks--such as ""Alexa, start reading from the beginning of the book"" seem beyond her.  A bright programmer needs to be assigned to enhance her capacity to interact smoothly with blind readers.Second and this is an inexcusable failure of engineering, I have been unable to find a way to allow my brother to listen to the books on headphones--which is essential when other people are around.  One can link the Echo to Bluetooth headphones, but that automatically disconnects the Bluetooth link to the Kindle.  Seemingly there can't be two Bluetooth connections actively simultaneously. Perhaps I am wrong, but I have searched Google with a variety of queries, and found no solution.  If the multiple Bluetooth connection failure is real and its correction is technologically unfeasible, then all you have to do is put a $2.00 phono jack at the rear of the unit and let the user plug in a set of wired headphones or plug in a Bluetooth transmitter to run wireless headphones.The Echo is a real improvement for my brother, but a couple of simple changes could make it a fabulous improvement!",https://www.amazon.com/All-New-Echo-Show-8/product-reviews/B0BLS3Y632/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1
Unknown,R1D7QO48Z43HU6,Critical,"Amazon Echo Show 8 (3rd Gen, 2023 release) | With Spatial Audio, Smart Home Hub, and Alexa | Charcoal",4.5,1.0,"13,840","TLDR: I work as a developer and love smart home products. I could not believe how difficult this thing is to set up. Will probably return it because I'm pretty certain that an ipad glued to a bluetooth speaker would be leagues better than this.Full complaint:So I purchased the echo show 8 for the primary purpose of being the visual component to the security system which consists of 2 blink doorbells, and 3 blink cameras. I wanted to put it in my kitchen so I could also listen to music, watch tv, or ask questions while I cook.Here are some of my major frustrations:~~~~~~~~Echo Show 8:1. Generally, the UI is just plain terrible. It is really hard to find things I am looking for and many aspects I can only change on my phone. Like why are there settings that can only be changed on a smaller screen?==>Amazon responded to this by saying that ""Echo Show devices are more voice-command centric with an added visual/touch component"" But literally every time you want the Echo Show to learn something new, you have to add it in the Alexa app on your phone... however, all Amazon needs to do is put the Alexa app on the tablet and all of these headaches would be solved!2. The home screen is not customizable at all. Sure there is a settings page with like 3000 toggles for things that can flash across my screen in a individual, full screen, marquis fashion, but I don't know how that could possibly be helpful. I'm just supposed to stand there and stare until the weather or whatever happens to swipe by?  Why can't I just have a screen with my most common apps on it? For example, I would love to have a home screen with a button for each of my common cameras, fire tv, and netflix. This is why I made the comment about a tablet glued to a bluetooth speaker would be better. I could have all the apps I want, where I want them. Siri will open the alexa/blink/spotify app for me.3. Advertisements. This concern is also with my Fire Stick but why are there ads? This is not a subscription service, I PAID for this device. I remember Amazon played this game with the Kindle so that you could by a cheaper Kindle that would have ads on the lock screen, but now they just put ads everywhere no matter what. Why can I not turn off ads?==> Amazon responded to confirm that you cannot turn ads off any of their devices!==> This is number 3 on this list but is also number 1 on my list of reasons I will no longer buy any amazon tech products in the future.5. Alexa will show me my cameras, but keeps telling me that it can't connect to either of my doorbells, even though I can view the doorbells in my Blink and Alexa apps on my phone.==> Amazon tells me to disconnect them in the app and try again, but, as I've already said, if you put the app on the tablet, this issue would would not exist or be easier to solve.While this review is about the Echo Show, my primary reason for purchasing was to use with Blink systems, so I'm going to add my reviews on them here too:~~~~~~Blink App/cameras1. Can't add multiple accounts to system. There are 4 people that live in my home, why can't I add members to the household instead of having to give them my email/password?==> It would also be great if I could give them different permissions or assign only certain doorbells/cameras as viewable to specific users.  This is standard in almost all of the other smarthome gadgets I have that involve security (such as smart locks, etc)2. If open my app to view the doorbell or cameras, it shows a live view for about 20 secs and then turns off. Why can't I just live stream? I'm still on the free trial, but it says I won't even be able to live stream at all if I don't pay a monthly fee, so, If I'm paying for a service, why can't I have the service??3. It takes way too long for any and all devices to load the camera view. This is especially critical when someone rings the doorbell and they have to wait for my app to open, then connect, and then for the audio to transmit4. Speaking of audio, when I turn on my microphone, the person on the other side can barely hear me.",https://www.amazon.com/All-New-Echo-Show-8/product-reviews/B0BLS3Y632/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1

I also ordered the stand that comes with the USB-C port, which is extremely convenient. I am thoroughly pleased with the echo show 8. If there is a drawback, it is that I see more advertisements then I would like. I have the photo display option selected in my settings, and I do not see my photos near as often as I did on my old device.

I've had several devices for years, just for the fun of it, but now I truly appreciate it as a life-saving device for the elderly. It is better than wearing a life-alert pendent--which studies show that the elderly will not wear, even when they have them. My sister has early stage dementia. We are committed to helping her live independently in her own home for as long as possible.  She is always misplacing her mobile phone, and then she goes into a panic.  Alexa to the rescue.  Now, if she falls, she can merely say, ""Alexa, call for help."" or ""Alexa, call [first name] [last name].""I got her 2 Echo Show devices: one for her bedroom and one for her living room.  Now, she can phone me through Alexa. She doesn't need to remember numbers or even operate her mobile.  I have written up commands for her to remind her that she must always say Alexa's name first.  Alexa will help her live independently and safely for longer.  The daily reminders that you can set are also important. I have set several reminders for her to take her night-time medicines.  And Alexa speaks the reminder aloud as well as shows the message on the screen.Also, with Alexa Echo Show 5, 8, 10 etc. you can drop in on a loved one and see what's going on in their home.  It's like a nanny-cam. This is an invasion of privacy, but it essential in checking on an ill or disabled loved one, and you limit those who can drop in on you to just a few trusted caretakers and point the camera in a way to preserve personal dignity.  It gives the hearer a warning that someone is ""dropping in"" and they can block the intrusion, should they want.  I think you can drop in on the audio versions also (you just can't see anyone), but those would be appropriate in a bedroom or bath.I'm still learning all the good things that Alexa will do.  It has a major learning curve, but once you set it up, it works beautifully--so long as your internet stays on.Of course, adding Alexa means that big brother is watching you and listening in to your conversations.  If you watch a TV show with a character named Alexa (e.g. My Life is Murder on Acorn TV), then your device can be very annoying.  But you just say, ""Alexa, stop.""These are small trade-offs for those of us who live alone and are getting up there in years. I'm telling everyone I meet who has an elderly parent about the importance of learning this resource.",https://www.amazon.com/All-New-Echo-Show-8/product-reviews/B0BLS3Y632/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1

For a couple of years, I had purchased numerous products from various companies with the hope that ""Matter"" would soon be available so that all of my various devices could communicate and work in tandem. The ""Matter"" standard may be coming, but not in my lifetime as a solution that I had hoped. Therefore I had a lot of various products just sitting there collecting dust, or if they worked, only for the same company to the point that enough was enough.So I began to purge non- Amazon products and go strictly with their eco-system.

Granted, I went from a 5"" screen to an 8"", but to me the sound of this device is truly what blew me away.I am still trying to figure out skills & such, but it is much less of a learning curve when using devices from one reputable company instead of hoping something may work with another.The display is bright and vibrant with color contrasts and it always recognizes me.

The Echo Show 5 has always been a reliable smart display, but this latest version truly steps up the game, especially in terms of sound quality.**Sound Quality:**One of the standout features of this Echo Show is its upgraded sound system. With 2x the bass and clearer sound than its predecessors, the audio quality is surprisingly robust for such a compact device. Whether I'm listening to music, catching up on the news, or watching videos, the sound is rich and immersive. It's perfect for smaller rooms, like the kitchen or bedroom, where you want good audio without the need for a larger speaker.**Display and Design:**The 5.5-inch screen is sharp and vibrant, making it great for watching short clips, checking the weather, or making video calls. The compact design fits easily on any shelf or counter, and the Charcoal color gives it a sleek, modern look that blends well with any decor. The screen's adaptive brightness is a nice touch, adjusting automatically based on the room's lighting.**Smart Features and Alexa Integration:**As expected from an Echo device, the Alexa integration is seamless. Voice commands are picked up easily, even from across the room, and the responses are quick and accurate. I use it to control my smart home devices, set reminders, and even follow along with recipes. The new smart display features also make it easier to see and control multiple smart home devices at once, which is a huge plus for someone like me who has a lot of them.**Privacy and Security:**Amazon has included a physical shutter for the camera, which provides peace of mind for those who are concerned about privacy. There's also a mic/camera off button, which is easy to use and effectively disables both the microphone and camera.**Overall Performance:**The Echo Show 5 (3rd Gen) is a fantastic addition to any smart home setup. It offers a great balance of audio quality, smart features, and privacy controls. Whether you're new to smart displays or looking to upgrade, this device is definitely worth considering. It's small but mighty, and I find myself using it more than I expected for everything from checking my calendar to watching cooking videos.",https://www.amazon.com/All-New-Echo-Show-8/product-reviews/B0BLS3Y632/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1

Some things I've learned:Do not expect this to pick up license plates - you can't even read the front plates of our cars parked 10 feet away. There are other home camera packages sold on Amazon that I plan on getting for better home surveillance.This is not a 24 hour recording device. It only starts recording once it picks something up or if you go into live view, and there's a slight lag to it, meaning the deliver guy might be walking away by the time it started recording.You may have to be creative in mounting it. I have siding, so it wouldn't be on a completely flat surface. I cut a piece of pvc board to get full contact.If you don't want to mess with recharging it, wire it into your existing bell wires. The terminal screws are right on the back. I did not realize they were the terminals screws at first, because of how they looked. You don't need to remove any covers to get to them. It will charge very slowly (as designed), but eventually it will get to 100%.You get a 30 day free subscription when you buy this. Ours just ran out, and it was very telling of how this product is designed for you to need the subscription. It is not just that you lose the recording of videos. I could live with that. All day I've been getting tons of motion alerts. It seems to be picking up cars driving down the street that are 30 feet out from the front door. When you are on the free subscription, it has person identification, meaning it isn't alerting you for cars driving by. When you are off the subscription, it alerts you for everything and just says motion alert for it all. I kept adjusting the sensitivity down trying to get it to not pick up cars and it seems like that was doing nothing. So, we caved, and paid for a subscription. As of right now it's $49.99 if you pay for the whole year, for one device. It's almost $10 more if you want to go month to month.It is nice having a camera at the front door, and it's nice to be at work and be able to see the front yard. I know the moment a package is delivered - sometimes you don't know even when you are home. I set up an automated message which starts talking after a few seconds of someone pushing the doorbell. It tells them we aren't home and that they can leave a message. This has worked well for solicitors, as they seem to leave as soon as they hear the message. We no longer have to peak out the window to see who's at the door.

Unknown,R2BT3K5VQPI4VM,Critical,"Roku Express 4K+ | Roku Streaming Device 4K/HDR, Roku Voice Remote, Free & Live TV",4.7,3.0,"85,583","I hope Roku doesn’t get too excited that I bought this and go out and celebrate with champagne. I actually have a ten year old Roku 3 stuffed somewhere deep in a closet or something and it would have worked just fine.  I already have 99.9% of what this does built into my high-end projection TV. The only reason I bought it is that the makers of my TV won’t pay the Netflix licensing fee so I can’t watch the very few things I want from that service on their projector. So the one and only thing this will ever be used for is that purpose. I know most people are here wanting to read reviews with specs and opinions about the picture quality and things like that but if I made just one person’s life better by letting them know for thirty bucks (twenty if HD is good enough for you) you can make your TV or projector think it is compatible with that streaming service.  And it does work.  And maybe I’ll pick up some additional content too, it looks like Roku is going big into the content creation business.PICTURE QUALITYIf you got this far, don’t have high expectations from any review of the picture quality, there is no answer. It is what it is, 4k is 4k, how it looks on your TV will depend mostly on your TV, and to some degree your internet provider, but in any case the Roku box isn’t going to have a very direct influence on what you see.QUIRKSOddly, Roku still uses line-of-sight infrared for their remote control while most remotes I am used to these days are RF. That means the receiver has to be located where the remote can “see” it. With today’s ultra-thin TV’s that can be a challenge because the sensor is located on the side not the face of the receiver, so for it to be “seen” would mean to try to stick the adhesive strip on an edge of a TV that can be less than a quarter of an inch, or even rounded.  As if that’s not bad enough in my case I am using it with a projection TV and my projector is located behind our seating area. The only thing I could do is to choose the best location I could which still means I have to turn around and point the remote backwards at the projection TV. This is 2024, why hasn’t Roku kept up with the real world?Also in the same category is that the four direct access buttons can’t be re-programmed. I know over the years they have changes those buttons as different TV sources come and go in popularity but what if one of the services (I’m thinking Disney) is something we would never use? That wastes 25% of the available buttons. Yet something we watch every day (I’m thinking YouTube) is not possible to assign to that unused button. Again Roku, this is 2024, even ten years ago I could assign my own favorites to a A and a B button, why aren’t you thinking of such things?DEALBREAKERSWhile I used the word dealbreaker I’ll temper that by saying I am keeping this product, not because I want to but because if I want to watch Netflix on my projector I have to. But if that were not the case it would go right back to them right now. It took me three hours to set it up and I am highly technical, I set most things in in minutes usually without reading instructions. If you have a desire to bring back technology for the 1980’s this is the device for you. The setup is maddening. Whether or not you want to use their power button and volume control with your TV, that’s not your choice, they force that decision on you and there is absolutely no way to get past that first setup screen after it hooks up with your wifi. They give you a list of TV brands. If yours isn’t on the list, sorry, there is no way of saying so or skipping that option. Your only option is something they call Advanced (it’s not) which makes the assumption that your TV’s remote is infrared (mine is RF). Roku never heard of RF so you are dead in the water at that point. There is a CEC option but that is way technical and I don’t have to discuss it here. So I went online and not surprisingly they don’t say a word about it. I went to the user forums and other people have the same frustration but there was a lot of “I don’t know or useless suggestions with no way to give feedback that they were useless.  I finally did come up with a way to confuse the device and move on but not after a good part of my afternoon was gone.YES NO MAYBEMy answer is that the HD unit at ten bucks less is so much the same that most people will never be able to tell the difference on 95% of what they watch. But if you are a perfectionist and ten bucks more isn’t a dealbreaker than you might as well splurge.  What about all the other models?  My opinion is your return on investment is very little with them, you get some nice but not necessary features but the price premium is far too much. Overall I would say this model gives you the best bang for your buck but that doesn’t mean I can endorse poor engineering and product design. They are resting on their laurels and shouldn’t be congratulated for that and anything more than an average rating is too high.",https://www.amazon.com/Roku-Express-Streaming-Wireless-Controls/product-reviews/B0916TKFF2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1
Unknown,R2PNTDNEFPDUHF,Critical,"Roku Express 4K+ | Roku Streaming Device 4K/HDR, Roku Voice Remote, Free & Live TV",4.7,3.0,"85,583","To begin with, the Roku format does provide a little more organizational usefulness than what you'd get from your smart TV remote (I am using it with a Sony Bravia). That being said, there is room for improvement of the Roku device from both an ergonomic and functional perspective.1) The mute and volume buttons are inexplicably located on the side of the remote...right where your middle finger rests when you are applying pressure with your index finger to operate the main control buttons. Consequently, as you grip the remote to operate the buttons you find yourself frequently muting the sound (or occasionally lowering or raising volume) with that middle finger. Mute and volume should be moved to top surface of remote IMHO.2) If you have ever had regular cable or Direct TV you are used to having a number define the channels. The Roku format does not use numbers to define channels, in fact it uses no numbers of any kind. You can sort and customize features of various streaming platforms into smaller groups to make them easier to find. Or you can go into voice command search and destroy mode looking for what you want. But be aware...the days of turning on the TV, punching a memorized three digit number into the remote and going directly to the exact place you want to be are over.3) The basic remote is almost useless in the dark. You would think by now most companies making remotes would incorporate backlighting as a given, but no. Roku seems to push the non-backlit model hard having their retailers place it in the equivalent of ""eyesight level, center shelf"" in all advertising. It's AFTER you buy it and find out how extraordinarily difficult it is to use in a dark room, you see the obvious need for it to be backlit. Only then do you discover YES, there IS a backlit model they developed. For double the cost of the original, of course.Call me a luddite, but I think a system more akin to regular cable 'channels' could have been developed and incorporated into each streaming platform format by Roku to ease the transition of the over 40 crowd from linear TV to streaming. And, as a significant portion of television watching is done in a dark room, I can't understand why every single remote associated with television viewing isn't backlit. However if you want to make your navigation through the world of streaming a bit more managable, Roku will make your life easier. I just suggest you go for the backlit model right up front. And make sure you get the backlit model for the Roku STICK or dongle. Most of them out there, particularly the cheaper models, are for the Roku TV and will NOT work with the HDMI plug in Roku devices.",https://www.amazon.com/Roku-Express-Streaming-Wireless-Controls/product-reviews/B0916TKFF2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1

If I push the pause quick like I used to, it pauses for a second and then tv show keeps going.  So have to hold the pause for a few extra seconds for it to 'catch.'  But when you push pause to continue the show, its the opposite - show starts for a few seconds and then goes back on pause by itself.  Next step will be throwing it out the window and digging out one of my old universal remotes because I know they work.",https://www.amazon.com/Roku-Express-Streaming-Wireless-Controls/product-reviews/B0916TKFF2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1

If you don’t have a Roku TV or any kind of smart TV, or want to use this with a projector or something else, this is a no brainer investment.I’ve purchased many of the older Express 1080p units and this 4K+ unit is basically the same with some added perks. The remote included with this unit is a voice remote and allows power control of the TV/display device all within the same remote. The old basic 1080p units did not come with this so it’s a great upgrade. If you use an external audio amplifier that integrates to your home theater via HDMI, CEC control can be used to allow the volume control to control that as well.All necessary cables and batteries for the remote were included. Also includes VHB tape (command strip) to adhere the Roku to your TV if you choose to do so.My application for this was a very early gen smart TV from 2013. Although it’s only 1080p it has a higher refresh rate than most TVs at that time, the picture quality is amazing, and it still works great so I saw no sense in replacing it.My only complaints are with the Roku design and platform, not this unit in particular:- Specific to the remote, there are a number of channel based services that would benefit from a number pad for direct dialing channel numbers. Roku does not support this, so OEM and aftermarket remotes will never be able to utilize this.- I’m a huge fan of the purple arrow buttons. Unfortunately they are rubber, not plastic. Easier on the fingers however they get gooey and degrade over time. I’ve had to replace a handful of Roku remotes over the years because of this- Dedicated streaming service buttons should be programmable. If I don’t subscribe to a service, I don’t want it as a remote hotkey. Interestingly enough, different remotes from different vendors all provide different variations of streaming buttons. There’s no consistency. At that rate, just get rid of them.Despite the small issues that bother me I still would not steer away from Roku as a platform.

The main reason I purchased this Express 4K+ player was to replace a 10 year old Roku 3 which had trouble with its YouTube app, and a few other apps that apparently were becoming Roku 3 incompatible. The Express 4K+ voice control remote has locked up a few times, however. (Just take out the batteries, and reinsert.) One thing that I had hoped was that the Roku 3's radio gaming remote would allow me to plug in headphones for use with the Express 4K+. But that DOES NOT work. The basic functions of the Roku 3 remote DO WORK on the Express 4K+ player, but the headphone feature DOES NOT. I believe the Express 4K+ player and Voice Control remote are IR optical only. Oddly, there is no obvious window on the front of the remote for the IR light to exit.One last thing- try to use the USB power adapter that comes with the 4K+ Express. I assumed that any old sugar cube type USB power supply would do, and some did not not.

I was looking for a way to upgrade my streaming setup and get 4K quality without spending too much, and this device has delivered in all the areas that matter most to me.Pros:Amazing Picture Quality:The 4K HDR support on this Roku is impressive. Watching movies and shows in 4K has been a noticeable upgrade in picture quality. Colors are vibrant, and details are crisp. Even older content looks better, and I’ve really enjoyed seeing my favorite shows in a new light with such clear, sharp visuals.Simple Setup and Easy to Use:Setting up the Roku Express 4K+ was so easy. I had it up and running in just a few minutes, thanks to the clear instructions on the screen. The interface is straightforward, and navigating through different apps and channels is super simple. Everything I need is right there, and I don’t have to spend time hunting for what I want.Roku Voice Remote is a Game-Changer:The Roku Voice Remote is one of my favorite features. I love how easy it is to search for shows or movies just by speaking into the remote. It works really well, and I don’t have to scroll through endless menus anymore. Plus, it controls both the Roku and my TV’s volume and power, so I only need one remote.Great Free and Live TV Options:I’ve been really enjoying the free channels and live TV access. The Roku Channel offers a solid variety of free movies and shows, and there are a lot of live news, sports, and entertainment channels available, which means I don’t need an extra subscription to watch live content.Tons of Streaming Options:Having access to all the major streaming services like Netflix, Hulu, Disney+, and Prime Video is perfect for me. I’m able to find whatever I’m in the mood for, and the device handles everything smoothly. The app interface is clean and easy to navigate, which makes switching between different streaming services hassle-free.Cons:Not for Gaming:While this device is great for streaming, it’s not built for gaming. If I wanted to play any serious games, this wouldn’t be the right choice, but that’s not something I’m using it for, so it doesn’t bother me.Audio isn’t Top-Tier:The sound quality is decent but not exceptional. The built-in audio is fine for everyday use, but it doesn’t blow me away, especially with the 4K visuals. I’m considering adding a soundbar to get better sound to match the picture quality, but for now, I’m still happy with how it performs overall.No Ethernet Port:The lack of an Ethernet port is a bit of a downside for me since I prefer wired connections for more stable streaming. I’m using Wi-Fi, which works just fine, but I do notice occasional fluctuations in speed. Not a deal-breaker for me, but it's something I’ve noticed.Final Thoughts:The Roku Express 4K+ has been an excellent addition to my setup. The picture quality is fantastic, the voice remote is incredibly convenient, and the setup was quick and easy. The free and live TV options are a nice bonus, and I’ve found myself exploring a lot of new content because of it. While the sound quality and lack of an Ethernet port are small inconveniences, they haven’t detracted from my overall enjoyment of the device.",https://www.amazon.com/Roku-Express-Streaming-Wireless-Controls/product-reviews/B0916TKFF2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1

In fact, when Netflix began its transition from DVD rentals to streaming services, the only way to watch Netflix was either on your computer or with a Roku device.  I have a smart TV, but it has a billion apps that clutter up the screen and which I never use.  Also, since its interface is android based, it need to have apps closed and the cache cleared on a regular basis or it will either slow down or some apps may stop working altogether.  So I bought this little streamer from Roku to skip all that bloat and extra work.  For the money, it can't be beat.  The only reason I took off one star is that the light on the front doesn't go off, despite the fact that I chose the option in settings to allow the device to go into standby mode when there is no activity after 20 minutes.  I called Roku customer service twice about this.  The first person I talked to didn't seem sure, but finally said it should stay on, although no rationale given.  The second person was certain it should go off like with my earlier model Roku's.  However, when I asked why mine didn't go off, I got no answer.

After doing some research, we bought this Roku Express 4K+ streaming player and found it works quite well.  We have hooked it up to an old Samsung 22"" TV (model code LT22B350ND/ZA) which was made in 2013.  Received it within a few days of ordering it and it took about 20 minutes to get it working.Ease of use: Follow the included instructions.  I plugged it into our power strip rather than the TV USB port since I heard that there were issues related to that (one report of fire, some issues with inadequate power, etc.).  Remote takes a little time getting used to - I haven't figured out what all the buttons do and I still haven't figured out how to slave the remote to adjust TV sound.  I can imagine that will make my life easier because I won't need to use the TV remote for anything else except for changing the input source and doing some TV fine tuning.  Volume adjust/mute buttons are on the side of the remote which was an issue for a few people, but I'm OK with it.  From past reviews, sounds like the remote is not very durable but that remains to be seen.Speed: quite responsive - no complaintsAppearance: The wireless receiver is quite unobtrusive.  This Roku comes with a mounting strip so you can stick it where you want it.

So much so that we will get another for our living room TV - it's a few years younger but we expect the Netflix and Prime Video software for it to eventually outdate.

I use them in the cockpit of a small plane, which is one thing Apple is now marketing the Mini 6 for. But I also use it for general tablet stuff; web browsing, watching YouTube, listening to music. I upgraded from the 5 to the 6 specifically for Pencil 2 support. The Mini 5 supports the first-gen Pencil, and while that was great as a first step towards going paperless in the cockpit for me, the way the Pencil 1 charges is just really an inconvenience for my use. I'd constantly get in the plane only to realize my Pencil is dead, and I'd have to just go back to paper anyway. I ended up just always carrying paper and a pen on me anyway, which kind of defeats the purpose of having the Pencil. So being able to have the Pencil 2 constantly stuck to the iPad and charging magnetically was enough in itself to get me to upgrade.You'd normally expect that any upgraded tech device would have all the stuff you liked about the prior model, but just with more power, features and/or a more elegant design. In the case of the Mini 6, though, I feel like it may be one step forward, two steps back. I'm really happy with the Pencil 2 support but not really with anything else. I may actually be returning it; I'll update this review if I do.First, jelly scroll is real. I'm always skeptical of complaints like this. They often start with one person who's either overly nitpicky or who just got a defective unit, and then they snowball as others with the same defect or a severe case of OCD write internet comments in agreement. But I was honestly shocked when I turned on my Mini 6, went to a random web page in Chrome, scrolled and saw the effect. It was much worse than I expected, and easily noticeable. It is difficult to believe this got past Apple's quality control.In reading some other articles about this, it seems clear that Apple's not really lying when they say this is ""normal LCD behavior"", but the problem is that they've mounted the screen controller in the Mini 6 sideways. If you look at the Mini 5, and pretty much any other tablet, you do see some jelly scrolling in landscape orientation, but not in portrait orientation. The Mini 6 is the opposite; it jelly scrolls in portrait but not in landscape. So it is, oddly, a landscape tablet. The weird thing about it, though, is that the controls are not really set up for that orientation, and I sure don't normally use it that way. It's not an efficient way to read web pages; the only thing it's good for is watching videos, where jelly scrolling isn't an issue regardless of how the screen controller's mounted.The screen is also slightly taller (or you could say ""wider"" if you consider it a landscape tablet), and that doesn't work well in portrait mode either. My Mini 5 shows 6 icons across and they are nicely spaced. The Mini 6, using the same settings (smaller icons), shows 5 icons across and they are weirdly bunched up in the middle. This could be fixed with an OS update but I'd never buy any product based on the promise of a future update. Also, it again is just a weird design decision from a company that's supposed to be all about design.I compared the screen brightness of the two tablets as well and while they're close, the Mini 5 is very slightly brighter. Again, I made sure they had the same settings - max brightness, Night Shift off, and True Tone both on and off. The Mini 5 screen always wins by a hair.Add to all that the removal of the headphone jack and I'd say that if you don't need Pencil 2 support, keep your Mini 5 or buy a refurbished one if you're in the market for your first Mini. Save yourself some money too. This was just not a very good update to the Mini line.Personally, I just need to decide if the Pencil 2 support is enough to overcome all of the Mini 6's downsides. My only viable alternative if I do want the Pencil 2 is the iPad Air, which is $100 more expensive and bigger/heavier... not necessarily an asset in a small plane carrying two people. The iPad Pro also supports the Pencil 2 but it is larger still and even more expensive. It's a tough call for me, but I'd definitely say that most people should get either a Mini 5 (if you don't need the Pencil 2) or an Air (if you want the Pencil 2 and have the space for a larger tablet).",https://www.amazon.com/2021-Apple-iPad-Mini-Wi-Fi/product-reviews/B09G91LXFP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1

You need to new aside a day and time (Appointment) to bring it to a Best Buy store 40 miles away and it only says cracked front screen only in the repair note. Tried to bring up another repair....only available for it is cracked screen. With no other option I would say that it is a good product but it is not supported well. I have no clue if she got water inside of it or it was defective. But somehow we are outside of the support and service loop. I will not be buying her another apple product but I will engage her more and I think we will both be much more happy in life.

I purchased the iPad Mini on a whim because I thought my 60-year-old eyes might appreciate something larger than the phone without the bulk of the iPad Pro.The iPad Mini in Starlight is an elegant little tablet, but after trying it out for several days, I found myself reaching for my iPhone. Here's why.While I gained some screen real estate over the phone, the Mini's text generally wasn't any larger without zooming in, and many apps I use didn't scale to its screen size. I missed Face ID, even though the Touch button performed admirably, and I quickly started longing for my iPhone's smooth-as-silk Pro Motion scrolling.Yesterday, I picked up the iPad Mini for one last time and sighed as it became clear that I never should have left my iPhone. I spent too much money on a shiny new thing that offered me nothing I didn't already have. I erased it, carefully repackaged it, and set up a return authorization.You might be pleased with the iPad Mini if you haven't spent years looking at Apple’s flagship tablets and phones, But if Pro is all you know, I suspect your experience will resemble mine.

I'm giving this purchase1 star because the return process was so time consuming and stressful. I bought two of these iPads - one for me and one for my grandson. When they arrived, I realized it did not have enough memory for my needs so I went online immediately to return it. I didn't even take the wrapping off. I kept the one for my grandson. And he really loves it! After I initiated the return process, I was not given a return label. Instead I was directed to wait all day for the UPS person to pick it up so I could sign for it.  It did not specify which day I was supposed to stay home. I didn't have an entire day to stay home so every day for 3 days the UPS worker came to pick it up, but I wasn't there. Amazon Customer Service kept telling me that UPS would leave a Return Label, but that didn't happen. Finally a supervisor sent me a Return Label, I paid for the return and UPS tracking showed it was returned. It took many more calls to ensure I got my money back. So the product is great, but the return is extremely difficult if you don't have all day to wait for the UPS person. Amazon Customer service personnel were polite, hardworking, and persistent regarding this problem - thank goodness!!

This girl would play Roblox all the time and she would not do any house chores or go outside anymore; she would be on that iPad for hours. Till one day her father broke it because she did nothing to help- out in the house. Years later… Yes, I was that little girl. I worked in landscaping trying to make money to buy a new iPad for school. I saw that all the iPads were too big, or they were too expensive. Nothing was to my liking, I wanted something small that could fit in any bag I carried or if I wanted to carry it would not look so big on my arm. That is when I gladly found the iPad mini. It was small and cute, but even with it being small. It was perfect for everyday use. It has Touch ID but there was no button on the bottom of the screen, it was on top of the iPad where the on and off button is. Making is easy access to use your iPad and do not worry it also has your basic 4 or 6 passwords just in case anyone wants to counterfeit your fingerprint. Now, let us talk about the battery on this iPad. It lasts up to the end of the day which is good if you take online notes in class. It comes in any style of service, as a college student I have Wi-Fi only on this iPad which is good enough for me. Let me get started on how you can decorate your home screen in your style, you can use photo widgets to create a pretty style, making it any design you would want. Like if you love the ocean your iPad mini can be based on the ocean by putting cute photo widgets of the ocean. My design contains a forest and my favorite color with a simple that is in the color dark green. Not only can you decorate your iPad mini you could also add other widgets to have fast access to any app if you do not want to look for it or you can put the widget on your Home Screen or even your Lock Screen. Speaking about the Home Screen the good thing about it is that you can split your screen, and I love that feature because it makes it easier to read a passage of a book and then the other screen has the questions and that makes my life so much easier, I tell you. Making it faster to do homework. You can now have another app open while doing your homework, with the multi-task feature that allows you to watch your favorite show while doing your homework!Not only is the Home Screen and Lock Screen the best thing out there, but your iPhone or Apple Watch connects to the iPad, which also lets you send a sneaky text message in class if teachers do not allow phones. Not only are text messages connected to the iPad but also if someone calls it shows on your screen as well. So, there is no excuse for why you do not answer your mom’s messages. If you love taking pictures of anything, the iPad mini camera has such excellent quality, or if you love to make videos and you need somewhere to edit, you can do that on the iPad mini too. Let's say you are an artist, and you love to draw on the iPad, the new mini canvas feature can get that idea on your screen before you forget. Overall, what I love about the iPad mini is that even with it being small, the price for it is not even expensive. It is in a fair price range perfect for my 10-year-old self to afford with the birthday money I would have had, if only my parents did not take it away. It is a perfect starter iPad if you are a college student or high school student. Or even if you want one like I said something small and light weight the iPad mini is your perfect fit.!",https://www.amazon.com/2021-Apple-iPad-Mini-Wi-Fi/product-reviews/B09G91LXFP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1

I even considered buying an iPad Pro: I have had two 9.7"" iPads (series 4 and series 6) so I thought I would miss a larger screen. Turns out, I didn't. I will give you a few hints on what to expect with this device:Pros:* Higher resolution: One of the main factors that led me to buy this tiny beast was the screen resolution (319 ppi),  which is higher than any other iPad's resolution. I highlight this feature because I use my iPad primarily to read and watch IT videos.* Portability (it's really lightweight! You will be astounded when you pick one of these)* Size (You can hold the whole device with one hand while writing with the other, something unthinkable in larger iPads).* Battery life (Discharge rate: about 5% / hour when playing videos; Charge rate: about 10% / 14 min)* TouchID (Very convenient, and it recognizes the fingerprint very quickly)* Stereo speakers (they sound really good!)* Apple Pencil support (When paired with an Apple pencil, it's a breeze. I'm using a note-taking application that allows me to use my iPad as a small notebook. It made me wish I had done this while I was still studying).* Three months of Apple TV+, Apple Arcade and Apple Music (Apple gives you three months of Apple TV+, Apple Arcade and Apple Music by only purchasing the device. So I'm enjoying a series in Apple TV+ ""For all mankind"" and it really looks great in this screen. I'm planning to watch other productions during these three months).Cons:* No silent mode switch (I use teh control center to lower the volume when needed)* No FaceID (I use the TouchID and it's very convenient and fast)* No raise to wake (I gently double tap the screen to wake it up).* No Promotion (There is no workaround to this. The device has a standard 60hz screen, so you will have to decide if you accept it or not)* Some users report sort of a ""jelly effect"" in the screen when you fast scroll the screen. I haven't noticed anything similar to this behavior in any direction (up, down in vertical nor portrait mode).A word of advice about storage:* If you're thinking about this device, go for the 256 GB one. That was my selection, and I'm glad I did it, because after only one week of usage, I have already used 35 GB of storage. Had I selected the 64 GB version, I would be worried about the storage already.Conclusion:The iPad mini lacks some features its bigger brothers have, but despite this fact, this is totally a great device. If you can sacrifice those features in favor of portability (or you find a way to sort them, as I did), you won't regret. Hopefully we will be able to see an ""iPad Pro Mini"" in the future (I hope Apple folks read this review someday), but for now, I'm very happy with this purchase. I'm declaring myself an iPad mini fan from now on.",https://www.amazon.com/2021-Apple-iPad-Mini-Wi-Fi/product-reviews/B09G91LXFP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1

I can edit spreadsheets easily if I need to and use it for work way more than I thought I would be. We have an iPad Pro 10 inch and the new 10th generation air and none of them seem to perform any better than mine does, but the big thing about it that is a HUGE for me is that it is SO small and light, super easy to tote around, doesn't really add any weight to my bag (which is great, I do a LOT of computer work and sometimes carry around more than one laptop.) I used this to replace my regular notebook and was just including a size reference.

My 12.9"" iPad Pros (one for work, one for home) are my go-to tools all day long.  Being visually-impaired, they're a godsend.  But, they're also heavy, and a bit clumsy in some cases.  As a magnifier, for example.For years I've been using an old 2017 10.5"" iPad Pro as a magnifier and general-use tool on my workbench. However, it was getting slow and cranky, plus the battery was losing charge pretty quickly.  I decided to replace it with this iPad mini, since compared to most dedicated accessibility tools, it's rather inexpensive.It turned out to be a good choice.  The camera is sharp, and the form factor makes it easy to get into cramped spaces.  Not to mention it's light: at half the weight of my iPad Pro, I almost tossed it in the air the first time I used it.What came as a surprise is how much I turn to it for other needs.  It's nice to use sitting on the couch and having VoiceOver read news stories to me, or to have text conversations with friends, etc.  Because it has a decent A15 SoC, it doesn't lag when doing VoiceOver.

My first was an iPad Pro from 2017, second was my iPad Air 5th generation, and then this little guy. My boyfriend received my 2017 iPad from me (it still works well), and I love my iPad Air, but it’s a hassle to take it anywhere unless I have an enormous purse, or my work backpack.Hence, I bought this iPad mini during prime day (awesome deal!)I got the starlight color and 256 gb Wi-Fi only model. I decided to pay the extra $$$ to get the larger memory so that I can have the freedom to download movies and tv shows for when I don’t have Wi-Fi. Also, 64 gb is hardly enough storage nowadays, at least in my opinion.I use my iPad for reading, streaming movies/tv shows, as a planner, as a coloring book and sketchbook, and surfing the internet. I also purchased an Apple Pencil, second generation, and I purchased a Paperlike screen protector— it helps me write easier and smoother on it.I love this thing!!! It’s perfect to take literally anywhere and fits in most of my purses. I will say, battery life is subpar, especially when compared with my older iPad Pro. The 2021 iPad mini and 2022 iPad Air that I own don’t have the best battery life, but at least they charge up quickly with the included usb-c charger. I guess the newer models don’t hold a charge as long, but when I travel I bring an Anker portable battery with me, just in case.Yes… jelly scrolling is real, but not a deal breaker for me. You see it, but I don’t find it distracting at all. It only happens in portrait mode when you’re scrolling quickly, and because it’s an issue I expected, I’m not going to fuss over or complain about it.I’m planning on purchasing apple care. If you get an Apple device, there’s no reason not to get it, in my opinion. Apple will replace the iPad under warranty if something is wrong with it (not including accidents) for up to a year after original purchase, but if you don’t have Apple care and something happens after that, you’re stuck with a hefty bill. So… spend the extra coin and get apple care.This isn’t as heavy as my iPad Air, I can easily hold it in one hand, which makes it perfect for reading and watching shows. I believe it weighs about .5 lbs less than the Air or something like that.I don’t notice much of a difference between this iPad mini and my iPad Air with the M1 chip in it as far as processing power goes. It’s still fast and powerful, and can tackle anything I throw at it with ease.Delivery was okay. Amazon sent me a code to give to the Amazon driver on the day of delivery (the day after I ordered it). The driver dropped the iPad case I’d ordered on my doorstep, then left. I had to chase him down to give him the code and get my package. So a bit aggravating, but it ended up working out fine.I would definitely recommend this iPad mini to anyone who is looking for something larger than a phone, but smaller than an original sized iPad or laptop. It’s super portable. Sure, a little small for setting up two windows side by side, but I don’t do that often. Wait for a sale and purchase it!

When I accepted, they said they would be happy to provide a refund but would prefer to provide me a different Anker portable battery that was more powerful. They wanted me to give their brand another chance because they stand behind their products. I accepted this offer, and they sent me an upgraded product in the mail, free of charge. They explained that the PowerCore Slim 10000 can only offer 6000-7000 mAh battery capacity to your phone. Even after I received the new product, Anker reached out to me to ask if the new product worked for me. This reaction shows that Anker truly cares about their customers.Original review:--------------------------------------------------After doing some research, I purchased the Anker PowerCore Slim 10000, but I am not happy with my purchase. The reason for the purchase was a backpacking trip I was going to take. From what I read, hikers suggested buying a name brand, like Anker, if buying a portable charger. When backpacking, you want to minimize the weight you carry so I liked the slim and light weight feature of this product.This was my first purchase of a power bank. I had received a free one that has a company logo on it that is the size of a flash drive. It is able to charge my phone 50%. When buying a power bank that is much larger and weighs over half a pound, I expected to be able to charge my phone several times. However, that isn’t the case with this Anker product.The main problem I have is that it only charged my phone 1.1 times (110%). I expected to be able to charge a minimum of 250% and hoped for 400%. The first night, I charged my phone from 15% to 75%, and the 2nd night, I charged my phone from 35% to 85%. That is all the Anker provided me so I was only able to increase my phone battery 60% after day one and 50% after day two, a total of 110%. Hoping it was a one-time thing and maybe the product would improve after the first use, I tested it again after the trip and got the same results. It wouldn’t even charge my phone much more than once.One appeal to me was the light weight indicated in the Amazon listing. The Product Information section indicates that the Item Weight is 7.5 ounces. The “Compare with similar items” on Amazon indicates the product is 145 grams, which translates to about 5.1 ounces. When I received the product in the mail, the User Manual indicates the product is 206.5 grams, which is about 7.3 ounces. However, all of these are incorrect; the charger itself actually weighs 8.4 ounces, the charging cable weighs .4 ounces, and the carrying bag weighs .3 ounces. Most people probably don’t care that the advertised weight is understated, but if you are considering purchasing this product for a through-hike, it would be nice to know how heavy the product actually is.Prior to purchasing, I had read a bad review where a buyer suspected receiving a refurbished product. Although my product was delivered in a stickered box and contained paperwork, such as the User Manual, I do wonder if I received a refurbished product too, since the product was only able to charge my phone 1.1 times.I think the product looks nice. I like how there is some indicator of how much charge is left; there are four lights on the power button that light up to show whether the charge is near 25%, 50%, 75%, or 100%.Since another reviewer indicated the product didn’t even work, I can say that I am thankful that I received some charge on my phone. It would have been very difficult for me to not be able to recharge my phone at all while on the trip. This is the reason I don’t give only one star.",https://www.amazon.com/Anker-PowerCore-Travel-Ready-Technology-High-Speed/product-reviews/B0D5CLSMFB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1

Here’s why I think it’s a fantastic choice for anyone looking for reliable portable power:Design and Build Quality:The Anker Power Bank is sleek and compact, fitting comfortably in my pocket or bag without adding too much bulk. The matte finish not only looks stylish but also provides a good grip, which is essential when you're on the move.Capacity and Performance:With a 10,000 mAh capacity, this power bank can charge my smartphone multiple times over. I've found it especially useful during long commutes or when traveling, ensuring I never run out of battery unexpectedly. It charges my devices quickly and efficiently, which is crucial when you're relying on it to keep your devices running.Port Options and Compatibility:I appreciate the inclusion of USB-A and USB-C ports, allowing me to charge multiple devices simultaneously. The USB-C port supports Power Delivery (PD) for fast-charging compatible devices, a huge plus for modern smartphones and tablets.Durability and Reliability:Anker is known for its quality, and this power bank lives up to that reputation. It feels solidly built and has held up well through regular use. I've dropped it a few times (accidentally, of course!), and it hasn't shown any signs of damage.Additional Features:One feature I particularly like is the trickle-charging mode for low-power devices like Bluetooth headphones or fitness trackers.

With a 10,000 mAh capacity, this power bank offers substantial power while remaining sleek and lightweight, making it easy to carry around.Battery Life and Charging Capability: The charger’s battery life is commendable, providing multiple recharges for various devices, including android/apple phones and tablets. This makes it a reliable option for long trips when you may not have immediate access to a power source.Size and Portability: The Anker PowerCore Slim 10000 is among one of the slimmest and lightest 10,000mAh chargers available. Its compact design is perfect for travel, ensuring it won’t weigh you down.Charging Speed: While the charger uses Anker’s PowerIQ and VoltageBoost technology for efficient power delivery, it may not charge as quickly as some fast wall chargers. You might find the charging speed a bit slower compared to those high-speed wall chargers, especially if you're accustomed to their rapid performance.Value for Money: This power bank provides solid value for its price. It’s well-built, with useful safety features like overcharge protection and temperature control.

However. There is no included instruction manual despite the safety sheet being included (which is required I’m sure), instead the safety sheet has a QR code to go to the manual. I have no real issues with this except I usually ignore the safety sheet.I attempted to charge the bank all day and noticed it didn’t increase at all in charge. Extremely weird. So I found the safety sheet after retrieving it from the trash, looked at the manual and noticed an oddity; the instructions for charging shows a usb-a to usb-c/micro-usb cable. I was using a usb-c to usb-c cable. I also came to the reviews to find some people saying the usb-c is output only (this is false) and they had to use the micro-usb so first I tested a usb-a to micro-usb cable and just like that it worked. But the instructions state that it charges at lower amperage using micro-usb so I wanted to test a usb-a to usb-c cable, and sure enough that worked as well.It’s bonkers to me that it not only doesn’t fast charge, but it outright refuses to charge unless it’s a 5V usb-a to usb-c/micro-usb cable. In a world where micro-usb is on the way out the door, and usb-c to usb-c is used a lot more due to fast charging and it’s just a better interface. None of this should prevent you from buying this, however, as they give you an appropriate cable to charge with and it’s good for what you pay for. I’ve always found Anker products to be respectable as I’ve never had to replace them.

I get 150-170 Mbps during network test. So why during Thursday Night Football I get pixelization and buffering? I’ve cleared cache but I rarely did that before. This stick is supposed to be better. Maybe there will be some updates soon to improve this otherwise I will have to rollback to the older stick. So if you’re thinking about upgrading, think hard as to whether you need to.So, I just got the NEW 4K Firestick today. I had the older yet same named 4K Firestick. Upgraded because this NEW one is supposed to be faster and better.First impressions. Is it faster? Well that is subjective in my experience. 30%? That would be noticeable, but I really couldn’t see that. There are no real objective ways to test.So out of the box, how did the installation go. Well, plugged it in and it immediately wanted to update which understandable based on reviews that said it need them. Well that was the first update. It rebooted itself only to launch into more updates. About 10 minutes worth. Then finally it pops a screen that says it recognizes me and if I wanted to restore settings from a backup. Why of course. I read a review that said it restored his settings to his previous Firestick. Well I guess my backup didn’t remember mine. The Home Screen was filled with all the latest bloatware and free trials imaginable. It didn’t remember any of my apps or any logins and passwords. After 30 minutes of cleaning that up I decided to test network speeds. I have a new Deco X60 mesh system that supports WiFi 6. It wasn’t any better than the OLD Firestick. Sadly, the Deco isn’t as sophisticated as most true routers so it doesn’t tell you detailed information about your network. How do I know? Spent an hour with TPlink. Another story.I have my 4K TV set up with an AVR system and the only thing the NEW stick recognized was the TV. Didn’t remember the receiver. Had to set that up. Not a big deal since it only controls power on/off and volume control.One last thing is the preprogrammed buttons. I appreciate Prime Video and Netflix but DIRECTV and Peacock. Seriously who uses those? At least let me reprogram them to something more useful.I did get an email from Amazon explaining what setup would entail. It wasn’t as detailed as you would expect for setting up an existing account. But it did say to have all your app info handy. It didn’t explain the lengthy update instructions either. But it was a forewarning. I was inspired by the one reviewers comments. Just didn’t happen for me.So do I keep it? Yes because it is their latest product and will likely get the most attention for upgrades and enhancements. And it wasn’t worse or downgraded from the OLD stick. Don’t want to lag too far in technology. I thought about the Max but don’t have any 6e capabilities.

Since they’ve always worked for the past 6-7 years, I never bothered.Well, thankfully there was a sale and I bought this fire stick.

I tried it behind my 75” Samsung…it made it in but it was a snug fit. Thankfully, my LG is built completely differently from the Samsung TVs and there’s no restriction.Secondly, I’m frustrated because this means I need to replace my second fire stick that is just as old but works fine and I’ll be stuck with these 2 devices because I cannot in good faith, chuck them in the trash. 🚮 I need an alternative to disposing these!",https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Fire-TV-Stick-4K-streaming-device/product-reviews/B0CJM1GNFQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1

Now (Sept 2024) i got this one. It’s been great. My old one got very hot and I’ve noticed this new one also gets hot but they’ve always worked. Must be normal operating temps. My old stick still works. I believe it's worth the update every 3-5 years. I also replaced my internet provider at the same time. When I 1st used this fire stick, my network was not the one I had saved on Amazon. (I had to change or rather add the new network to save on Amazon). The setup still went very smoothly. I stream at 1080 (on a 1080p tv)  but this  is 4K ready. The interface is much the same but a few UI changes are noticeable. I can tell the new one has more processing power. Well worth what I paid for the device. I have used Apple TV, MAX, Netflix, Hulu, MGM+, and YouTube. (Prime video) and others in the 1st week. All of these work well. People claim the Fire stick is for Amazon users, but it’s a cheap and easy way to use pretty much all streaming services.Amazon gets the concept of providing a low cost device that doesn’t overlook quality...to get business...however you can still easily use other services.

I never thought I'd say this about a piece of Amazon Tech, but for numerous reasons, the Firestick TV 4k has quickly become my favorite cloud gaming console, and here's why:1. I bought it on Prime Day for $29. It's $59 full price. And even at full price, it is by far the cheapest device capable of cloud gaming.2. Fire TV has apps for Playstation, XBOX and Luna, which support MOST popular games. Sadly, Rocket League and Minecraft have not made the cut. But the free games included with Luna are still better than the free games on most other platforms I've used.3. The Firestick 4k's interface is much smoother and faster than my other consoles. My Nvidia Shield in particular has a clunky, slow interface. The Firestick puts other interfaces to shame.4. The firestick 4k boots games faster than my other consoles. It appears to perform better than the XBOX One during gameplay, but not quite on par with the Nvidia Shield TV Pro (which is to be expected).4. XBOX, Playstation, Switch Pro, Luna, 8BitDo, and almost every 3rd Part controller will pair to the Firestick easily from the settings menu. Connected controllers automatically turn on when turning on the TV using the Firestick remote which is another cool little feature.The Firestick 4k is proof that cloud gaming can be fast, easy, and incredibly affordable. For under $100, you can get this streaming stick and a top notch controller. That's nuts.

I inadvertently purchased a show I can get through another streaming service for free because I assumed the default would be play free to me. It was not.

Unknown,R2HPXMGZOYW55I,Critical,Apple AirTag,4.6,2.0,"11,755","So, when looking up info on these tags, I heard that they weren’t meant to be used to track pets. However, I had no other option, and others were using it for that, so it seemed worth a shot. I did check to see if any other company made something like this, but found nothing at the time. Since then, I heard that Samsung makes a better tag. Sad, but it is what it is.Anyway, I got a collar for my cat which holds it, put it on her, and let her out. It showed her bouncing around randomly all around the house even though she was sitting still under the porch not even 10 feet from me. I’m okay with the large circle representing the area she could potentially be in, but I feel like the closer I am to her, the more accurate it should be. Instead, it never seems accurate. She isn’t even in that circle 50% of the time.I would have given the tag 1 star if not for the fact that we moved, I let her out, and she got lost for most of the day, but it did help me get her back inside (only) after she found her way back home. I was extremely annoyed that the only way to find her beyond my yard was if she got close to an iPhone or iPad. It appears that only maybe one person in my neighborhood has either. I’m not mad at them. I’m mad at Apple because how exactly does this help find anything without others having Apple devices? If we didn’t waste money on Apple devices, this tag wouldn’t be worthwhile even if you gave it to me for free.The only reason this was helpful at all was because I turned on lost mode and it notified me when she was outside because she was close enough to be picked up by my iPad. She kept passing the house in confusion, but the last time it notified me as I was looking at Find My, and so I was able to catch her before she ran too far away again. I’ve noticed that if I’m not looking at Find My, it doesn’t update. Again, that doesn’t help find a lost item unless you take the device with you, keep the screen on and the app open.I’m away from home now and a friend stops by to check on her. My friend has an iPhone, my cat tends to stay in my bedroom, yet if I don’t have Find My open while she’s there, it won’t update. The Apple name means less and less every year since Steve Jobs left us. So sad. Maybe they should focus more on the quality of their products than lip service.

Except Apple has made it really really annoying by telling anyone with an iPhone that comes near you or to your home or anywhere near by the air tag owner that they are being followed !!! I bought this for my bag.  Yes I carry a man purse, an expensive one and would like to track it if left behind.  I always had an extra iPhone that did a great job of doing just that and notifying me if it behind.  But I lost that phone to a nice thief that needed it more than I, it’s safe to guess,  with the unbeatable security they got through security and disabled my phone and my lost mode. Nothing to track it or get it back.  The police well , filled out beautiful paper report that I may use I guess as junk paper.  No one went to look or get it while lost and actively sending a signal.  The air tags work well , great gps location tracking , great battery life.  I like the sound it emits if lost to find it and makes it much easier with a loud and audible high pitch tone.  Here is my big problem with the air tag, all good Except if you travel with someone for couple days or hang out with a friend everyone becomes paranoid because everyone will get the darn warning : you are being tracked by an AirTag.  Even though all you doing is commuting together.  I feel like it puts my friend at a heightened level for no good reason.  But one has to wonder what are they so worried about or  hiding ! Why is everyone so afraid of being followed and receiving the dreaded msg that an Air Tag has travelled with u last couple days.  When that happened to me, to be honest, I freaked the heck out couple years ago.  I searched all over my car never got it figured out or got it to ring. Nothing just an annoying and freaky message saying you are being followed.  But the message was popping up daily for four days while I was moving to my new home.  and now I’m making others freaked out about being followed when all we are doing is commuting together or grabbing a beer.  Friends don’t spy each other right? … lol, I don’t really think if someone is being a spy the Air Tag is a good tool of the trade for them.  It tells on you in a heart beat.

It was easy to put on and set up. I live in a small town but, everyone today usually having a cell (iPhone being most popular) I thought it might work well to be able to find him. AirTags use Bluetooth signals to connect to nearby devices in Apple's Find My network to locate your AirTag. When an AirTag connects to a device, its location is triangulated and sent to iCloud, where you can view it on a map in the Find My app. He has gotten out twice since I purchased it, and both times it has taken a long time to find him. The alerts take a long time in between, sometimes taking 30minutes. It’s not the phone network as we have very good single here in town. I thought with living in town that the alerts would work more frequently, but I think the population with the find my network must be pretty small. It still worked better than blindly searching, and does help us find him, I was just hoping it would be a little quicker and easier to use. I also was frustrated that both my husband and myself could not both search for the tag. It only allows one individual at a time to utilizes it in the find my network. The tag can be transferred back and forth but not used at the same time, so you can not separate and search.

That’s why I decided to buy these on Amazon. However, I’m not sure if it’s because the seller wasn’t directly affiliated with Apple, but these AirPods seemed used when I received them. There was dust inside the box, and one of the AirPods even had earwax or something on it. That was a big letdown for what was supposed to be a brand-new product.As for the AirPods themselves, they work well. The sound quality and spatial audio are excellent, just like my original pair. However, the battery life hasn’t been as good as expected. For the first two weeks, they held a charge fine, but now, after just about a month, the battery doesn’t last as long as it should. It’s a bit frustrating, especially since I expected the same long-lasting battery performance as my previous pair.Overall, I still love the AirPods, but the condition in which they arrived and the battery issues have me questioning whether this was truly a new product.

Especially since with my current AirPods starting to crap out. However, I’m going to be giving this review from the perspective of going from the 2nd gen AirPod pros to the 3rd gen. And it seems like bit of a downgrade.Now, the 2nd gen pros have it all. The extra silicon tips, the noise cancellation & transparency, & the ability to wirelessly charge (the case). And I had them for a good long while (the longest I’ve had any AirPod) & the right bud is just starting to crackle when I play any audio through it and the battery is starting to go bad.Overall, I was honestly a little disappointed with the 3rd gen. Granted, it’s not a pro version so it’s not going to come with the noise cancellation. But the lack of silicon tips for the buds was a little surprising. I have trouble with any earbud staying in my left ear especially, & I’ve used the 3rd gen during a few workouts so far & they’re staying pretty well. But, they still feel just a little off & I ended up buying silicon tips to put over the buds instead - those helped with a bit of noise cancellation and security in my ears. But to go from the 2nd gen pros to the 3rd gen feels like I’m losing a lot when it comes to function & capabilities.Now, if you’re buying a pair of AirPods for the first time & just need the basics - then the 3rd gen is great. The bass sounds really good, overall sound quality is there & the buds without the silicon tips really aren’t that bad. If you’re used to that though, it’s going to take a bit to adjust with the 3rd gen.

Unknown,R17PCXJJIHJN4B,Critical,"Apple Watch Series 9 [GPS 45mm] Smartwatch with Midnight Aluminum Case with Midnight Sport Band M/L. Fitness Tracker, ECG Apps, Always-On Retina Display, Water Resistant",4.7,2.0,"7,427","After using a Fitbit versa for 4 years, I was ready to try something new. I did a lot of research and found that the apple watch was good for fitness and health tracking, as well as having lots of extra features that many fitness watches don’t have. Here are my thoughts are one week of using the apple watch 9.The band: Because it is more of a mesh material, I was worried about the band staying wet. I get very sweaty during workouts and I like to rinse the watch off after. I found that it took about two hours of wearing it for the band to dry completely after getting wet. Not great, but also not too bad.The charger: The charger uses a USB c connection. This is a bit of a nuisance because it did not come with a wall adapter. The only place I can plug this in is into my laptop.The watch itself: The watch is sleek; I like the screen size and overall look. The watch controls are easy to use, the haptics/gestures are a nice touch.Watch faces: I was disappointed in the selection of watch faces. There are limited options compared to Fitbit/Garmin, and most are analog which is not my preference. I find digital time to be easier to read at a glance. Half of the watch faces were from Nike - I don’t have any interest in being a walking Nike advertisement. Many of the watch faces are very customizable, which is nice, but the big failure here is that there is no option to see your step count on your watch face. I like to be able to see my daily steps at a glance, but it is not possible unless you download yet another app (more on this later).Health Tracking: The first thing I noticed is that the watch is not constantly reading your heart rate. On my Fitbit, I loved to be able to see my steps and my current heart rate at a glance. The apple watch is not constantly reading heart rate, so it says something like “65 BPM - 8 minutes ago”. It is not super useful to me to know what my heart rate was 8 minutes ago.Exercise Tracking: This is where I was really disappointed in the apple watch. One morning, I performed yoga for 15 minutes. I started a yoga activity before the workout, and it counted as 15 exercise minutes. Great. Later that same day I went to play tennis. 90+ minutes of high-intensity physical activity. I forgot to start the exercise on the watch - not too concerning to me because Fitbit recorded cardio exercise automatically. I was dismayed to find at the end of 90 minutes, my total exercise minutes was only 30. 15 from yoga, 15 from tennis. The watch also did not prompt me to start a workout during tennis, which it sometimes does while walking. It seems like with the apple watch, you have to be extra careful to start an exercise - otherwise the fitness tracking will not record correctly at all. Again, I really liked Fitbit, which automatically recorded exercise for me in an accurate way if I forgot to “start workout”.Health Data: The first thing that annoyed me is that your fitness/health data is spread across multiple apps. You have the Health app, the Fitness app, and the Apple Watch app. I don’t like having a ton of apps on my phone, and don’t see any reason why health/fitness couldn’t be wrapped up into the watch app. For me, the watch app should contain all of the data the watch is collecting. Fitbit/Garmin have a single app that make it easy to view data.Sleep tracking: The apple watch does a pretty good job tracking sleep and includes lots of data like heart rate/respiratory rate. My biggest complaint is that it does not tell me what time I fell asleep and what time I woke up like Fitbit did. I also really like that Fitbit gives you a sleep “score”, and I don’t see anything like that for apple.Battery Life: Obviously the battery life on the watch is not nearly as good as Fitbit/Garmin etc. This didn’t really bother me though, I charged it for 15-20 minutes every day while I showered and this was enough to keep it going.After giving the apple watch a try, I decided to return it and go with something more fitness focused. I was disappointed because I had been really excited about the apple watch. It does have a lot of cool features and technologies, and I really liked the detailed health data that was collected. However, I felt that apple fails to present this data in an accessible way. I was also really disappointed by the exercise tracking. The watch is supposed to auto-detect exercise but after 90 minutes of tennis, it recorded only 15 exercise minutes and did not include an entry in the exercise history at all (within the fitness app). If you care mostly about smart watch technology and phone/watch integration, I think the Apple Watch 9 is a good option. But if you are focused on fitness, I would recommend going with another option.",https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Smartwatch-Midnight-Aluminum-Resistant/product-reviews/B0CSTFHP3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1

It has been years since I have worn a watch.  It is easy to pull out my phone.  Yes, it is convenient to look on my wrist.  $300 convenient?  I am just getting used (after 3 weeks) to the short battery life.  Unless I put it on low power mode, which requires multiple button pushes and scrolling, I get less than a full day on a charge.  In its defense, 50 years ago, when I had a wind up watch I did have to wind it every day.  In low power mode I get 2 days/charge unless I do more than 2 hours of exercise.  That was less than one minute of winding vs 1 hour or more of charging, though.  It is nice to be able to check my heart rate anytime.

I love my Fitbit, but I also ALWAYS wanted to try out the Apple watch. Don't buy this if you are looking forward to a watch that has any focus on health. It's clearly an afterthought for this company that they feel they HAVE to begrudgingly have to be relevant.I didn't realize that the apple watch looks fancy, but it's literally just an iPhone on your wrist. And what is the point of having an iPhone on your wrist if you have an iPhone...and you HAVE TO HAVE an iPhone if you have an apple watch.Here's what this watches original hardware cannot do (you'll have to pay 3rd parties for these things):It CAN'T tell you your overall caloriesIt CAN'T tell you how much you sleep without you setting a sleep timer. It has no auto-tracking for sleep.It CAN'T tell you a sleep scoreIt CAN'T tell you O2 readingsIt CAN'T tell you the meaning of your sleep. It almost can't do anything at all in terms of wellness.It CAN'T tell you when you're in cardio, fat burn, or below heart levelsIt CAN'T tell you anything with ease. Everything is complicated compared to the simple layout of a Fitbit. The charts are almost meaningless. I have to click on 3-10 different pages to find what I want amongst 3 different apps that come with the watch. (Fitbit has ONE app that does it all)You also won't be able to access your designated apple health app through your watch. YOU HAVE TO go through your phone to access it. But you can access other third-party apps on your watch. MAKE IT MAKE SENSE.For this watch to have so many watch faces focusing on health, you'd think they would have incredible health and wellness features, especially since they have so many competitors. But obviously, it's all for show. All you'll ever know from Apple's ""genius"" three-ring health goals is your ""stand hours,"" your ""active calories,"" and your ""workout minutes"". That's it. That's all it is. There's not much more to it.My advice is to skip the Apple Watch if you want it for health features and buy a smart ring instead.",https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Smartwatch-Midnight-Aluminum-Resistant/product-reviews/B0CSTFHP3W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1

Those headphones were the kind that ""plug"" into your ear, and they were exceptional. Great noise cancelation, great call quality and battery life. I loved the JBL app and i loved th headphones themselves. So when it was time to replace them, I went on amazon, typed in JBL headphones and quickly ordered this pair that were a bit more expensive, but I felt confident in the choice (the JBL brand has already won me over so I felt comfortable going with a higher priced one without much research, thinking that the cost would be representative of the level of quality, and the quality would be the same/better as the previous headphones, a pair i bought from kohls for about $30 btw)Unfortunalty In my haste, I didn't notice that these are fundamentaly different headphones than what i had before. These are the kind that ""sit"" in your ear rather than ""plug"" into them. I noticed this right away once they arrived and was disappointed....my fault for not making sure, but still. Here i was. I found myself in a predicament. I needed to keep headphones since I was about to board a plane for a vacation, but these weren't the ones I wanted! And they are kinda pricey. Ugh. I decided to keep them and give them a shot. I tried all the different size fittings and found some that worked-ish. Now it's about 3 weeks later and I'm here writing a review.Ultimately the headphones have a good quality feel, good battery life, etc. And im sure they compete with the other major brands and outperform them for the price. But to me, these and just not good headphones. And I postulate that this design is just plain inferior to the ""plug"" in kind in every regard.These never really feel like they are secure in the ear, they don't seal in the ear to create rich deep bass and smooth mids. When there is even the slightest breeze the wind catches them and sends a blast of whistling noise in through the edge of the earbud. And most dissapointing to me,the active noise cancelation doesn't seem to do diddly squat. On my other pair. The difference of turning ANC on/off was night and day. They really blocked out the sound!. On these, there's hardly a difference. Certainly not enough to justify wasting battery life on the feature.Ultimately these may be fine for you if you know for a fact you like this style, but my opinion is these are, and always will be an inferior style of headphone.

It doesn’t sit well within the socket, and bc it doesn’t identify the connection, it stays connected to my phone. I lose my place when listening to music/podcasts, and more importantly the battery does not charge. The left earbud dies quickly, doesn’t connect to the charger, doesn’t disconnect from the phone, and won’t reconnect to the phone when coming out of sleep mode.

Unknown,R3J2LJUCI76D64,Positive,"JBL Tune Flex - True Wireless Noise Cancelling Earbuds (Black), Small",4,5.0,"6,004","Update after 5 months of use:A quick update of the ear buds.  The charging of the ear buds is fast.  Going from ""low battery"" to full takes a short amount of time.  I think a minute or two.  Never timed it.A couple of issues:* Taking calls on it is hit or miss.  Often the headphones will get out of sync and it will do a weird binaural thing where it will alternate between each ear getting cut out for a split second back and forth for about two seconds.  This can happen multiple times in a minute.* Over a bit of time of playback, the earphones will cut out for about 2-3 seconds.  I'm not sure why.  Maybe some sort of sync issue?  More annoying when listening to an audio book than music.Original Review:This review is for:  JBL Tune Flex - True Wireless Noise Cancelling Earbuds (White), SmallOverall, I like them.  Video mode has no audio lag.  They sound good with boosted base and sealed tips.I really wish there was a way to turn on the headphones without the case.Highs:* When using to go to sleep, the pillow won't accidently activate the touch controls (very nice).* Touch controls are responsive and are easy to activate.  I haven't had them accidently double activate so far.* Video mode has no audio/video lag.  Must be enabled in the app.  By default it is set to Music mode.* Good sound.  They sound very good when using the bass EQ, music mode, and the sealed tips.* Fit is good.  Three sizes for sealed tips.* Can setup each touch control to a different command set.* Important! : If you want volume control, it must be setup in the app.* Has a ""find earphones"" function (only when still turned on).  Emits a tone and is easy to hear.* Has an optional auto standby which also optionally deactivates ANC.  For example: With some other earphones, ANC will stay on even with auto standby enabled.  If using them to sleep to, ANC being on all the time will cause the battery to be low by morning.* Good Bluetooth range.Lows:* Hard to get out of the case.  This seems to be common with all case based small headphones.  There isn't a good way to grip them and they won't shake out.* When getting out of the case, it's easy to activate the touch controls over and over.  (Skip, play, pause, volume up.)* No way to turn on the earphones without the case.  Not even with the app.  Cannot force standby either.* This means that if you forget the case, you can't put them in your pocket because the touch controls fire randomly.  The app can turn off the earphones.*  Couldn't tell a difference between ANC on or off.  With or without the sealed tips.  But I was not really surprised for small in ear headphones.Other:To put on or take off the tips, use a credit card or spudger to separate the white tips from the body.  The sealed tips are easy to add and remove.",https://www.amazon.com/JBL-Tune-Flex-Wireless-Cancelling/product-reviews/B0C1QNRGHC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1

The sound quality is pretty good for what it is and I really like the battery life that I've gotten so far. There are a few things that I don't care for though.  I'm not sure if there's a setting to change it, but anytime there's wind or air movement the earbuds make a crackling sound. Not sure if they're trying to cancel that noise out or what, but I work in a machine shop so we use air guns quite a bit and it's less than desirable. The other thing is that after five months or so the right earbud stopped charging. I've cleaned the contacts on the earbud itself as well as the contact in the case but still can't get it to charge, so now I just have one functioning earbud. I usually only have one in anyway, but I liked to alternate between the two sides to stretch battery life a little.For the amount of money I spent on these, I definitely don't regret buying them.

Initially, I was excited about the solar charging feature, which seemed perfect for outdoor activities and emergencies. The power bank itself is well-constructed and offers a substantial 42800mAh capacity, which is great for multiple charges of my devices. The fast charging capability and the built-in super bright flashlight are excellent features that add to its versatility and convenience.However, I encountered a significant drawback with the solar charging functionality. Once the power bank is completely drained, it is nearly impossible to recharge it using just solar power. While the solar panel does work, it is extremely slow and ineffective for fully recharging the large battery capacity. This limitation is quite disappointing, especially for a device marketed as a solar charger. Despite this, the power bank is still useful when charged through traditional means and offers ample power for extended use. For the price, it provides good value, but the solar charging aspect falls short of expectations. Therefore, I would rate it 3 stars.

Unit was later set outside for a couple of hours in direct sunlight on a 22 degree afternoon.  Not sure if 3 days worth of direct sun exposure would have increased the charge to a third bar. Maybe best to use the solar feature on a fully charged battery to keep it topped off.  As for solar charging a smartphone, maybe an hour or two would be sufficient  to get a 1 to 3 percent charge.Unit was later fully discharged and then charged with a fast charger.  It was plugged into the fast charger at 7:00pm and left to fully charge throughout the night.  By 5:00am, it was charged.This 42,800mAh device has some heft to it.

TOPDON or equivalent Battery Booster Jump Starter Pack might be a better choice.  Some of them like the one in the picture come with a 12V Cigarette Lighter Socket Adapter.

The first thing I'll say is that this charger is pretty big and very heavy.  It's OK for a base camp, but I don't think I'd want to lug it around.  There are much smaller and lighter battery packs to keep in a pack or pocket.That said, as a means to recharge your phone or one of the smaller battery packs, this device may be a good choice.  After receiving it, I first charged it to full capacity (4 indicator lights).  Water that, I left it near a window and used it exclusively to recharge my Galaxy S21 from 5% or less back up to full strength.  I charged whenever the pho e was at or below 5%, regardless of daylight vs after hours.  I also charged my wristwatch with it.  I got 5 full phone charges and 2 full watch charges before the charger ran dry.  This took close to a week.  Once it was plugged back in, it charged to full in about 3 hours and we did it again.I have not yet evaluated how rapidly it will recharge itself using only solar power, but most are pretty slow.

Unknown,R2WQ277CRK2GDW,Critical,"Amazon Kindle Scribe (16 GB) - 10.2” 300 ppi Paperwhite display, a Kindle and a notebook all in one, convert notes to text and share, includes Basic Pen",4.3,3.0,"8,079","TLDR: The basic reading functionality is very good.  The pen isn't that useful.  Software is still pretty limited if you don't want to use reading glasses.My last kindle device was a kindle DX (yes the giant one that was released more than 10 years ago).  I gave up waiting for Amazon to release something that amazing and went with the scribe. The screen is very paper like, the resolution is crisp enough that letters look very good and readable.  The page turning speed if very nice.  The actual feel of the pen writing on the screen is very much like pencil on paper, this part was very unexpected and pleasant experience.  Finally, it's a good weight for hold and reading for extended periods of time.Here's where all the complaining begins.  This device is pretty expensive for what it is and it's not like this is Amazon's first kindle product so I believe these complaints are justified.1. You can't use the pen to write on most books.  None of the books I would want to write on can be written on.  Since the pen is kind of the marquee feature of the scribe this is very a surprising limitation.  Why would one want to do this and not leave a note:  a.  The notes are represented as little dots to tap on and aren't really read in-line with the book.  b. Some books like cook books are basically meant for you to personalize.  Like cross out which ingredients you already have when making a shopping list.  Notes on taste.  Variants you want to try. c. You have different types of notes you want to make (e.g. TODO vs idea notes) and you won't be able to see this unless you expand the notes.2. It's 2024 and presumably Amazon still has software engineers in its employ so that they can make small changes like...changing the font size of the non-book part of the display.  The most obvious fail in this issue is that the dictionary is still at the default font size regardless of the size chosen for the book.  I don't know about most people that use the feature, but it's a big selling point that I don't need to use reading glasses to read books on the Kindle: I can just make the font size larger.  This limitation is even more perplexing when you are browsing the kindle store on the device where everything is rendered in a tiny font.  It's like they don't want me to be able to discover new books on the device and buy them.  Which brings me to.3.  The kindle store is integrated into the home page, but I often don't care about the categories that are displayed.  I want to go to the store and shop it like the regular amazon site like as if I want to shop and buy something.  In the ancient DX there was a menu item to just do this.  Again this is a perplexing move as if amazon is not interested in acquiring more of my money.4. One side of the device has slightly more bezel than the other side.  This should be side side you use to hold the device.  It's just the right side for my big thumbs.  Great.  Oh wait I just shutoff the device.  They put the power button in the middle of the side where the device is held for reading.  There are three other sides to the device (if you don't count the front and the back) that could be chosen for this functionality. Three sides where this wouldn't matter.  Three of them.",https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Scribe-the-first-Kindle-for-reading-writing-journaling-and-sketching/product-reviews/B09BS26B8B/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1

It does have a larger screen, and a wide margin for holding the device whilst reading.I am disappointed though. I looked forward to making notes on the pages of books I have purchased. Not a note that is viewed separately. The underlining and highlighting are the same as in previous Kindles.The notebooks are okay. The pen is good. I appreciate the eraser function. I downloaded several of the notebooks available, such as the Gratitude Journal and puzzle book.My expectations were too high. I have several journaling books on my Kindle, as well as “how to draw” and lettering books. Unfortunately, I had envisioned being able to write and draw directly on their pages. Yes, I can create a notebook, but then I don’t have the book content immediately available unless I use another device. For the price, I’m not impressed.Perhaps I am spoiled because I have an iPad Pro. Unfortunately, the Kindle app doesn’t allow writing on the pages of the books either. I can’t import the Kindle files into my Notebook apps the way I can with pdfs.That might seem picky. I knew it didn’t have the colour screen like the Kobo Libra or the Pocketbook Era. None of the e-readers seem to have the ability to write directly on the pages. I do appreciate the fact that we can import pdf files into the Scribe Notebook section and scribble to my heart’s content.So, I guess my expectations were too high for the e-ink technology and the proprietary format of the Kindle books.Other than that, I LOVE the larger screen. I’m glad they brought the larger screen size back. I wish the power button was on the back, or top edge because I keep inadvertently hitting it.I do have a couple of covers for my Scribe, though I am constantly taking it out because it simply gets too heavy if I’m reading for more than a few minutes.I do like my Scribe. It is an improvement on the Kindle Paperwhite, which was an improvement on the original Kindle. I chose to continue with the Kindle Brand, after purchasing the first Kindle AND early Kobo.My eyes appreciate the e-ink format. As I age and my eyesight worsens, this works much better than the iPad/tablet screens.I just hope Amazon gets innovative and improves the technology.You can listen to audiobooks with Bluetooth headphones, which is a decent option. I haven’t tried listening to an audiobook and using the notebook function.It isn’t waterproof, which should be standard at this point. I’ve never read in the tub or near water, but I am a bit klutzy with my beverages, so the added security would be nice.I did receive the “premium” pen. It does write well and has an eraser function, as well a a button that can be programmed with different options (one at a time). It doesn’t seem pressure sensitive. I suspect that is an issue with the screen technology. I have yet to try converting hand-writing to text.So, it is an upgrade from the Paperwhite, mainly for screen size and limited notebooks with a pen for writing.",https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Scribe-the-first-Kindle-for-reading-writing-journaling-and-sketching/product-reviews/B09BS26B8B/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1
Unknown,R23SDWQZA3575P,Critical,"Amazon Kindle Scribe (16 GB) - 10.2” 300 ppi Paperwhite display, a Kindle and a notebook all in one, convert notes to text and share, includes Basic Pen",4.3,3.0,"8,079","I have been eyeing the Scribe for a while and jumped at the chance to get one with the current sale ($279 - 32 GB plus Pencil Pro). These are my first impressions, and I will update them as I spend more time exploring the features. I also found many reviews outdated, not reflecting the newest software upgrades. *This review is not yet complete, but I wanted to share my initial impressions. Stay tuned for updates.*### My Reasons for Getting a Scribe:1. Reduce eye strain and prevent disruption of sleep from reading other devices at night.2. Consolidate all my books and notes into one lightweight, portable device with dependable battery life.3. Reduce distractions such as notifications, web browsing, memes, etc., which tend to derail my reading or journaling when I use my iPad.### Kindle Tablet vs. Kindle AppI would also like to note the different features exclusive to the Kindle Scribe vs. the features available on the Kindle App on any tablet, like an iPad. This is important for me to determine if I really need the Scribe or if any tablet where I can download the Kindle app would suffice.### Opening the Box, Writing, & First Impressions:#### Look and Feel of the Device:- My thumb hurts from holding the Kindle, as the charging port is right where I tend to hold the device. It’s a very impractical place to put the charging port, and why is it so sharp? (May Update: this has been solved by using a case)- The device isn’t particularly aesthetically pleasing. It’s black, and the side holding piece looks unattractive, although it is a very helpful feature. (May Update: Apparently they sell stickers for these things were you can cover the black part, front and back. I have not tried the stickers yet)- The pencil locks in place on the side, but it falls off easily when I transport the Kindle from one room to another. (I still need to get a case.) (May Updated: Solved with the case)- The eraser feature is awesome! It feels very natural to use the pencil. I love it. (May Update: still love it)- The highlight (or extra feature) button is a good addition, but it’s a bit out of reach and doesn’t feel as ergonomic or easy to switch as the eraser feature. (May Update: getting used to it)- The fountain pen feature makes my writing look pretty amazing, if I say so myself! (May Update: love!)- The big screen is fantastic! It’s just like reading a book. I have the Kindle Paperwhite, which is very portable, but I tend to set the text at a very large size, so I can’t read much on one page with the Paperwhite. The Scribe fits more content.#### Writing Feel:- I LOVE the feel of writing! If you check my past reviews, I have returned notebooks because the paper was scratchy, thin, or deficient in some way for my level of sensitivity. Not with the Kindle Scribe. I love how it feels; the experience is very elegant and motivates me to keep writing. I also have an iPad with a pencil, which I use a lot, but I really dislike the feeling of writing on such a smooth, glass-like surface.### Evaluating Reasons:Evaluating how it meets my reasons for getting a Scribe (vs. my iPad, iPhone, or another device):1. **Eye Strain:** The device DOES reduce eye strain. It is a very different experience than reading on a tablet. I like how you can set up the Scribe to automatically adjust the brightness and warmth depending on the environment.2. **Eliminating Disruption of Sleep:** This has not yet been accomplished, as I find holding the Scribe is not very comfortable, especially with the sharp charging port. It is maybe a tad too big/unwieldy for holding with one hand. So, I am still using a tablet and waiting for the arrival of my Scribe cover to see if this makes it more comfortable to hold while in bed. (May Update: This has been solved with using a case, propping it using the case and using dark mode at night, I love reading at night with this thing, now the problem is trying to NOT get TOO interested in the book :)  )Well, this is it for now. I have BIG gripes about the distractions, notes features, and clunkiness of the software both on the Scribe and Amazon Content and Devices page. I will continue my update in the next few days.### May Update:3. ** Notes: Well this took me a while to figure out.My best advice is to make a list of what are the top must haves for your use.  I looked at so many YouTube videos, read reviews, etc. The Scribe is compared in these reviews to the Supernote or the Remarkable, or Boox, iPad, etc), except for me, the #1 consideration is PRICE.  If I could spend $600 - $1000 for these devices, I would listen to the reviews, maybe go with the latest Boox, but, at the sale price of the Scribe, it is in my range, so I do not expect it t have all the features of a $1,000 device like an iPad.For  my purpose of ""2. Consolidate all my books and notes into one lightweight, portable device with dependable battery life."" it has served me well enough within a price I could afford. Could it be better, have more features, the software do more, be more user friendly, YES! But it is what it is. I am happy with the features at the sale price point.  I would not spend $350 for the Scribe though.Now for the notes:- You have Kindle books and PDFs in your Library and your Kindle Notebooks, well in the Notebooks section.Here is how they differ:- Kindle books - with ""sticky note"" technology. You can place a sticky note and write on the sticky note and then email the notes to yourself.  You cannot annotate directly on the book.- Kindle books - with NO ""sticky note"" technology. Besides the usual Kindle features you would find in another Kindle, the Scribe wont do anything special in these books.- PDFs - You can directly write on the PDFs! Yay! You can then email these notes to yourself. It seems you cannot sync or maybe even view these notes in other kindle devices, but I have not tried that feature.On the Notebook section:- Here you have your Kindle Notebooks. Just choose a template and write. You can do basic writing and there is templates for lined, dot, grid, monthly, weekly, daily schedules, blank, etc. You can only have ONE template per notebook. So you cannot have a cover page that is blank, and the second page be lined, etc.Again, the features are basic, if you have used iPad or Notability, Goodnotes, etc, the Scribe does not have all the bells and whistles. I think the latest update the fanciest it gets is a ""lasso"" to copy and paste your text and the ability to add folders. You can email these notebooks for yourself. You cannot edit them in other Kindle devices.OK, so this is current to the current software update. I hope Amazon adds more features, especially the ability to straighten the highlighting!  I am still new to this device.### Conclusion:For now, for my purposes, my budget, the ease on my eyes, ability to use while I sleep, hold all my books (Kindle and PDFs), to read the books with ease on a large screen and the basic writing abilities are enough to be content with this device.  If you have a larger budget or are looking for different features, this may feel to limited of a device.",https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Scribe-the-first-Kindle-for-reading-writing-journaling-and-sketching/product-reviews/B09BS26B8B/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1

ONLY italic, and you can’t vary the line thickness on any of the implements, including the italic fountain pen, so whether you like that line you see in my picture or not, that’s what you get,  (hint: amazon, thinner lines would facilitate usefulness of the tiny stickies that we can’t put in books.)pros: i got the scribe, and some headphones to go with it, precisely so i could listen to audiobooks and write or draw (what they call doodling, possibly because drawing sounds too intimidating?) sounded great.cons:  only you can’t do that.  you can draw in a notebook, OR you cam listen to audiobooks, but not both at once.  so there’s absolutely no audiobook advantage to the scribe at all that i can see. i already listen to audiobooks externally while i’m working, and i’ll have to continue to do so, and return the unnecessary headphones…not to mention that it couldn’t find my audible library.  (!)  all ready to have me buy new ones, sure, but the 600+ audiobooks books already in my audible library? were nowhere to be found.  i called amazon customer service and was told, among other things, that you can’t listen to audible books outside of the audible app, which is simply untrue (where do they get these people, mars?). i kept on pushing and they kept trying to transfer me back to the same clueless audible person until finally i screamed so loud they gave me to somebody in the kindle unit (honestly people, was that so hard?) who said it was a known issue, that the library wasn’t working and that to get to my library i would have to go to the website and send it to the scribe, only it’s  not called the scribe there but something like “my 347th kindle”.  which, of course, takes the scribe out of the loop altogether, other than as another dumb terminal. (when i looked a few hours later all my audiobooks were there in my audible library, so why didn’t they just say it would take some time to populate? morons.)why did i buy this?  it doesn’t do anything i haven’t already been doing on my ipad for years, and not nearly half as well.  the only actual advantage i can see is it’s nice for reading and the pen doesn’t slide around on the screen.  so why am i not sending it back immediately?  well…i like it. it does look nice. and i still hope it might tempt me to read more, i can give it a bit more time to see if i even use it much. and i’m a sucker.now let’s see if they publish this.",https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Scribe-the-first-Kindle-for-reading-writing-journaling-and-sketching/product-reviews/B09BS26B8B/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1
Unknown,R27242X778X6HJ,Critical,"Amazon Kindle Scribe (16 GB) - 10.2” 300 ppi Paperwhite display, a Kindle and a notebook all in one, convert notes to text and share, includes Basic Pen",4.3,3.0,"8,079","+ Best hardware for the money+ Warmth and brightness sliders for the back light+ Pen requires no batteries, is light, and writes with minimal latency+ Great battery life (dropped just 2% overnight)+ Easy export of annotated documents to email- Writable pdfs necessitate minutes-long process of uploading them to Amazon's cloud on another device, then downloading them on the Scribe- Writing Toolbar always on screen while writing on a pdf- No landscape orientation optionThe Kindle Scribe has a lot of potential. The hardware is amazing. None of its competitors seem to be able to match the hardware--a 10.3"" screen; a backlight with not only adjustable brightness, but adjustable warmth; a writable surface, long battery life and a responsive stylus that does not require batteries--for the price. In fact, it's difficult to find another eReader that checks all of these boxes at all. It's thin, relatively light, and more comfortable to hold than a hardcover book of the same height and width, though re-learning how to hold it has been a bit of an adjustment coming from a Kindle Paperwhite and Kindle Fire 8. For me, the larger display more than makes up for the slight hit to ergonomics. My only quibble with the hardware is that erasing with the premium pen takes a surprising amount of force. Applying sufficient pressure to to depress the eraser button and dragging the pen feels to me like I'm going to scratch the screen. I haven't yet, but using the shortcut button to erase with the nib is much more pleasant and requires much less pressure. Other than that, it's difficult to think of a way to improve the hardware. Particularly, reading at night with the back light's warmth adjusted to filter out blue light is pleasant and unlike any other device I've used. It's excellent.The software, though, is where it becomes evident that this is a first-gen product on its first firmware revision. The big one for me: Although the promotions and ads are correct that you can write on pdfs on the Scribe, **you can only write on pdfs that you send to your device through the Amazon portal in a web browser on another device.** If you simply drag and drop a pdf onto the device over USB, then that pdf is going to be read-only. This reliance on Amazon's cloud service was not mentioned in the product description or advertising anywhere (**EDIT: Amazon has revised their product page to address this omission), is annoying, and raises some serious concerns about privacy. If you're sending an ebook in pdf form (typically 5-6mb), then the process of opening your browser, dragging and dropping it into the Amazon portal, waiting for it to upload, then opening your kindle, waiting for it to sync, finding the new item, clicking on it, waiting for it to download, and opening it is cumbersome but tolerable. If you're hoping to write on an even larger file like a scan of a book, though, get comfortable: the 50mb scan I uploaded took twelve minutes! Over a 500mb/s fiberoptic connection! Having to use proprietary web software to get usable pdfs to a separate device feels like a holdover from 2005. Having it take several minutes feels like a holdover from 1998.Aside from being unwieldy, dependence on a third-party cloud for writable pdfs presents a privacy problem. One thing I was hoping to do with the Scribe was grade student papers. I was picturing simply dumping a folder full of them onto the Scribe via USB or even WiFi over my own network. The first isn't possible and the second now seems like a distant dream. I can't in good conscience send my students' work to Amazon's servers. So I won't. **EDIT**: Amazon has since updated their product description attesting to the security of their servers. I believe them! But I still wouldn't feel comfortable managing students' work on the Scribe unless/until I'm able to transfer them back and forth over USB.The other issue with writable pdfs is that the Writing Toolbar must be on the screen if you want to mark up a pdf using the pen. This means looking at a dime-sized icon of a pen on every single page of whatever you're reading. Sure, there's an option to hide the icon, but doing so reduces the function of the pen to mere pointing and scrolling. If you want to write, then you're going to have to tolerate the icon. Why not offer an option to hide it while remembering its previously set function? Why not at least make it smaller and have it expand upon tapping it? Maybe it won't bother you, but I find it incredibly distracting.Lastly, there's no option to read in landscape mode, meaning there's no way to hold the Kindle on its side to view two pages at once as you might on an iPad. You're locked into portrait mode. Being able to hold the tablet sideways would've been welcome while reading lying down, which is a little tricky with the screen as tall as it is. It's also too tall for the shelf of the treadmill I like to use while reading sometimes, but a portrait mode option would've been fine. Hopefully this is an option that will become available as the Scribe firmware matures.If none of these three software shortcomings bothers you, then I don't think you'll find a better deal for comparable hardware. For me, though, they may be deal-breakers, which is too bad since the device itself is by far the best I've ever used to read ebooks.",https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Scribe-the-first-Kindle-for-reading-writing-journaling-and-sketching/product-reviews/B09BS26B8B/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1
Unknown,R3L24VP1U4OJSY,Critical,"Amazon Kindle Scribe (16 GB) - 10.2” 300 ppi Paperwhite display, a Kindle and a notebook all in one, convert notes to text and share, includes Basic Pen",4.3,3.0,"8,079","Anyone who has used a Kindle knows how pitifully crude and rudimentary its document management is and continues to exist in unacceptable fashion.  Organizing books, identifying duplicates and even simple appearance is akin to beta software circa 25 years ago. It's about time Amazon actually made a modicum of effort, especially since I came extremely close to buying an Android ereader but for a rare major sale and acceptance that this is an ereader and not the tablet it purports to be. I'll explain why.1. Inability to connect a bluetooth keyboard. This is completely unacceptable. Very few will bring along a 10"" device and not have the ability to have a keyboard for note taking, which was standard at least 5-10 years ago.2. Inability to easily organize notes, with books and collections having the same issues. We need some nested folders for organization and basic file management tools that have existed for decades. If you can't provide them, Android readers are worth every penny of the extra $100 they charge now and dropping.3. No basic apps other than Kindle reading and note taking. As above, if you're portable with a 10"" e-reader, I can't imagine anyone not also using it for basic email management and communication. This requires you to take a second tablet or laptop because it cannot satisfy basic demands expected a decade ago.4. No audio capability other than Audiobooks. Wake up Amazon. You're not keeping us in your ecosystem but making the device incapable of playing audio files and without any MP3 player or audio app. I have books that use MP3 files and not useful if on such platforms - such as language and other instructional books. In addition, sometimes I like to listen to music while reading, soft classical in the background. I'm far from alone.5. Note taking feature is poorly implemented and gets in the way of reading. To give you an example of how lazy the development has been, there is a big circle that stays on the screen for note taking options while reading. It cannot be moved. It gets in the way of documents that I have open that go closer to edge to edge reading, which I enjoy far more than big white margins. Hard to believe anyone would design it like this and features are barren. Other reviews cover that part.6. Amazon's own platforms are unacceptably deficient. If you try to use Amazon's web platform to organize books, even that doesn't have an identification of all books that are not tagged or labeled for organization like there is on the actual devices. This type of oversight is completely unacceptable as it requires you to scroll and individually look at every book to see if it has a category/folder/collection, wasting huge amounts of time. The Android app is also barren of many features and looks like it hasn't been touched in a long time.7. Very limited e-reader options other than Amazon's format, e.g. PDF. There is no way to zoom in text and lock the screen for PDFs. This common feature allows you to maximize the visibility of viewable PDF text on the screen and push the white borders out of view. Right now, you still need to crop the borders out and reprint every book (if you can) because the Kindle software cannot do this for PDFs. If you're getting a 10"" tablet to view docs, especially PDFs, this omission is another baffling bit of laziness that will cost you huge amounts of time if you read books that have illustrations, charts, etc. and benefit from the slightly larger screen space of zooming in docs and removing needless white borders.Bottom line is this. When other ereaders and basic software is light years ahead of this device - whose hardware is excellent - you know it's time to consider abandonment and move onto something far more useful with value for the money. Unless Amazon invests a modicum of effort, I'm very confident you'll find the better, high end Android readers a much better value. And if you value your time, basic book management features will save you huge amounts of time that make any premium price worthwhile without even thinking about it.The hardware itself is great. But others will rip apart the pathetic, dated software that Amazon treats as a cash cow with its brand name until you recognize the limitations and the pen being mostly a gimmick.Come on Amazon - up the game here! No other leading tech company would allow its products to languish and look this poor in comparison to the competition. You're close to the tipping point of people flipping to alternative products and the basics are not expensive to add. Just do it!",https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Scribe-the-first-Kindle-for-reading-writing-journaling-and-sketching/product-reviews/B09BS26B8B/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1
Unknown,RKG0JYRJ51TI,Critical,"Amazon Kindle Scribe (16 GB) - 10.2” 300 ppi Paperwhite display, a Kindle and a notebook all in one, convert notes to text and share, includes Basic Pen",4.3,2.0,"8,079","Generally I love a Kindle but this so far is a failure. For the amount this device costs, I really regret purchasing a Kindle.I do like that you have the option of setting a lock screen and that it is not mandatory.I am extremely frustrated that for the amount this Kindle costs and its so-called accessibility features (which are not), do not address those of us who love to read and have visual disabilities. They should have consulted with someone who has visual disabilities before calling it accessible. It's like the place that says it is wheelchair accessible but the wheelchair won't fit through the doorway. Lot of promise ahead if you can just get through the door.I have changed the settings to LARGE for the print but the large is equal to the regular default print on a computer screen.. not very large 10-12 pt?  (I enlarge my screens using CTL - scroll wheel on the mouse.) In a book you can enlarge it but, real catch, your clock and page status stays extremely small so what good are they when you need large print? Might as well leave that option off. I do like to have it on so I can see how far I have read and since I read at night I like to see how late it is...  Need to resort to my clock instead.I have had to resort to using a magnifying screen/glass to read what is on this device. This makes it impossible to hold and read so I have to use a cover that I can use as a stand to use this device for reading.I would love to see some color to add contrast. The light grays are hard to make out against a white background and don't show up when you invert the pages to dark background. The warm background is not as warm as I would like (I have sepia on my Tablet). There is no way to adjust the contrast to enhance the grays.I also got this because of the ability to write in documents and notebooks. Just like the Samsung Note phone. I am disappointed in the features of this Kindle. Many of these features are ""still coming""... I was able to load some Word documents I had written but not that someone else had written. Quirk? My son is a songwriter and we were sending documents back and forth. I thought this would be nice so I could edit or make notations on his documents. We are still working on the perms so that we can exchange PDF and word docs to make notes on. Not as straight forward as one would hope. He is not using a Kindle to create his documents.Also in the notebooks there is dead spaces in the upper right and lower right corners that can't be used. These are areas that are used to turn pages I think ... can't really write on them and have trouble trying to erase what marks get put there when trying to write there.The Kindle is easy to hold with the left side giving plenty of space to hold without putting your fingers on the screen. The premium pen is handy for noting things and writing in notebooks and taking notes in documents (that let you). I haven't noticed a change in the brush when I click to change it though. It is light and easy to hold. Just be careful not to click the button while writing. I have spasms in my fingers and have learned that I need to turn the pen so my finger does not rest on the button.It does have Google Search which is by far a lot better than Silk.The battery seems to last.  This is good since I use my Kindles a lot.This isn't a long review. I'm not going to get into the tech stuff. That is all covered in the description and by tech buffs.  It is a Kindle. It does the Kindle stuff but unfortunately this Kindle is not geared towards the visually challenged. Yes, I am visually challenged/disabled, but have had absolutely NO issues with my Kindle Fire Tablets.  This has the e-ink and other features that I was sure I would love. I might -- if I could enlarge them to read the screens and not be so frustrated.Think twice if you are thinking of getting this as a gift for someone who is a senior or has vision issues. Get a Fire Tablet instead... at least you can adjust the print size and the colors help to make out what is on the screen.About the touchscreen. Mine seems to be finicky. Sometimes when I tap it responds, other times it ignores me (which seems to be the standard response). Usually I need to resort to the pen to tap on the screen to get it to react.Storage -- does it hold a lot? Yes. I have a lot of documents loaded and still plenty of space.  Just wish I could enlarge the print and read them.For the above problems with the print size, I have gone through all the available Amazon help pages to find an answer. They don't have one except for a couple that say submit feedback, which I have done. There is no available work around or fix at this point. Sadly this is a first generation and knowing Amazon I will have to purchase a whole new Scribe to be able to access the fixes to the print. I think I will just stick to the Fire Tablet. I am not buying another Scribe.Again, if you are visually disabled/challenged or thinking of getting this for someone who is (elderly or ???) be warned that the print is very small and can't be enlarged on the screens, only inside a book... see my note above.UPDATE:  and addition 02/05/2024 I learned this because I now have a drawing tablet --- the glove that you use with the drawing tablet really  helps in using the notebook feature of the Scribe (very inexpensive just need the glove that covers the last two fingers - drawing tablet gloves). It helps keep you from accidentally turning pages or other little annoyances because your hand is resting on the screen.. Still no change in enlarging print on the menu screens, only inside a book but the clock etc are still incredibly small. I wanted to share about the glove... it really helps when using the notebooks.",https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Scribe-the-first-Kindle-for-reading-writing-journaling-and-sketching/product-reviews/B09BS26B8B/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1

I've installed the latest firmware update (v5.16.1.2.1), and it's fixed a few of my original issues.  There's so much more that Amazon needs to do, so the 2 start rating stays for now.I'm currently using the Scribe every day for _all_ of my note taking.  I still can't read or access the notebooks from my computer without emailing them to myself, one at a time... but at least there are now sub-folders available to organize the notebook files.If Amazon doesn't open up the ability to sync my notebooks to my Google Workspace within the next 4 to 5 months, then I'm going to need to switch over to an Apple iPad or Remarkable.  The friction that this is causing is simply not worth it, and there are much better solutions available on the market.  (I can read my notebooks on my iPhone Kindle App, however.)The ""go to page in notebook"" update is helpful... but it's in the wrong location in the user interface.  There's PLENTY of room to put an icon in the main toolbar.I love the new ""pen types""!  Pressure sensitivity is great.Bottom line... this is still for ""early adopters"" only, or users who specifically want a Kindle Book Reader with the ability to take _only_ a few notes.  Amazon really NEEDS to start making more firmware updates a LOT faster.  The Scribe has a LOT of potential, but with 1 minor update in 5 months, it feels like they are not investing much in their developer team for this product.Good luck finding the documentation on how to update your Kindle's firmware on amazon.com.  (Use google to search for ""kindle scribe firmware update"" instead, and it will link you directly to the right page.)Lastly... I could really use some OCR in here.----MY ORIGINAL REVIEW:I’ve been using my Kindle Scribe almost daily for the past 10+ weeks primarily as a digital note taking device.First off, apologies for the long review.  Nutshell: this thing is “ok”, but it doesn't really do what I was hoping it would do (yet).It’s comfortable to use.  Super fast user interface response.  Writing with the ""Premium Pen"" is good and comfortable.  Display is great, and just like all similar devices, it has a slight “hazy glare” when viewed at certain angles to a light source.Adding notes to a Kindle book is relatively easy to do (it makes sense once you figure out how to do it).I'm giving this a 2 star review because it feels like it’s the first version of this product, and it still has a LOT of CRITICAL features that need to be added for it to fully compete with the other “e-ink style digital tablets” on the market.Below are some thoughts, criticisms, and feature requests:1.  I cannot sync and read my notebooks, notes, or highlights on my computer.  The only exporting option is emailing each Notebook to myself, one at a time. This is NOT a solution in 2023.2.  I uploaded a work-related PDF to the Scribe, and then made highlights to the text.  I cannot view those highlights on my computer!  They are forever locked on my kindle.  This is NOT a solution in 2023.3.  I cannot write in the margin on that uploaded PDF.  One can only make highlights and add notes.  This is NOT a solution in 2023.4.  I cannot EDIT my notes on my computer.  You can only email a PDF copy to yourself.  That’s it.  Think of this as a tool that replaces pen and paper, and you can scan a copy of your notes.  This is NOT a solution in 2023.5.  I cannot sync my notes to my Google Workspace, Microsoft OneDrive, Dropbox, Box, OneNote, Evernote, Notion, etc.  The competitors do this today.  If this is remotely important to you, then look elsewhere!6.  No “Handwriting Conversion” feature.7.  Move “note objects”.  I'd love to be able to select an ""object"" that I have written and move, scale, or rotate it.8.  Brushes?9.  Layers?10.  Share screen/presentation on a Zoom meeting.  The competitors do this today.  If this is important to you, then look elsewhere.11.  Pen is NOT pressure sensitive.  The competitors do this today.  If this is important to you, then look elsewhere.12.  Pen is NOT “tilt sensitive”.  The competitors do this today.  If this is important to you, then look elsewhere.13.  I needed to relocate some of my overhead room lighting to accommodate the slight glare on the screen (but I would have needed to do this regardless of tablet chosen).14.  Printing notes (or an annotated PDF) requires emailing the document.15.  Cannot make subfolders of Notebooks (WTH!?!?).  You can only organize documents one level deep.16.  It doesn't remember the sort ""state"".  For example, I want to sort the notebook folders by name… and the folder contents by date.17.  Infinite canvas paper.  How cool would that be!18.  No icons or indicators on the Notebooks, Folders, or UI, indicating Notebooks have been synced and successfully backed up.19.  Only 8 items fit on a screen in the Notebook “view” regardless of Grid or List view.  One has to scroll down a page because the screen layout User Interface wasn't thought out properly.  There are no settings to adjust the size of the icons.  The List view is, amazingly, just as useless.20.  Can't change the delay time to lock the screen.  I'm sitting in a meeting, listening to a speaker... I look down to take some notes... and it's already locked.On average, Amazon’s documentation, tutorials, and videos, are NOT their strongest skill set.  If I were in charge of Amazon’s Kindle Scribe Documentation Team, then I would suggest that they look towards Apple, AWS, or Google for some inspiration.I love being an early adopter, yet knowing what I know now… I would probably not buy this.  I recommend this only for early adopters who really ONLY want a Kindle reader with some extra functionality to take an occasional note or two.Unfortunately, the Kindle Scribe really doesn't solve the problem that I was hoping that it would.  One of my friends has a rather ""remarkable"" competing product, and insists that I try that one instead.  Personally, I think my next tablet purchase will be an iPad Pro.",https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Scribe-the-first-Kindle-for-reading-writing-journaling-and-sketching/product-reviews/B09BS26B8B/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1
Unknown,R3RJATQQFSNGBL,Critical,"Amazon Kindle Scribe (16 GB) - 10.2” 300 ppi Paperwhite display, a Kindle and a notebook all in one, convert notes to text and share, includes Basic Pen",4.3,3.0,"8,079","As most of the reviews (both here and on third-party sites) mention, this is a great piece of hardware. The screen is clear and responsive, the backlight is uniform, the rear case is lovely, the pen feels lightweight and tacky enough for a solid grip...it feels far more premium than any other Kindle I've owned. Reading Kindle books is also very enjoyable. While it's not as easy to hold as a smaller Kindle, the screen size and sharpness make reading a joy, and the ability to handwrite in the sticky notes is much easier and more fluid than typing as I did on previous Kindles.The main issue with the Scribe is the software, and I'm not confident Amazon is willing to invest the time and resources to make this anything beyond a big Kindle you can (sometimes) write on. Below is a list of bugs, annoyances, and missing features that you should be aware of prior to purchasing. I'm sure there are plenty more, but this is what I've noticed after only 24 hours of using the device.1) PDF Navigation - Links to other pages in PDF documents do not work on the Scribe. I imported the ESV Digital Scripture Journal, which I used extensively on my iPad without issue, and the links are all broken. I tried every method of upload (Send to Kindle website, Send to Kindle email, side loading via USB-C, etc.), and the links will not work. Because I know this PDF works on other readers and the issue exists with both Send to Kindle and side loading, it has to be an issue with the Scribe software.2) Exporting ""Watermark"" - Exporting notes puts a giant Kindle logo in the top right corner of the page. I had hoped to make notes and then share via email (which works without issue), but when I do that, my notes are sullied by an unnecessary and ridiculous Kindle logo. This is maddening.3) PDF Inconsistency - PDFs are handled differently depending on when they were uploaded and the method of upload. The only way to annotate a PDF document is to use the Send to Kindle feature after November 2022 or so. You cannot write on any PDF documents previously sent to a Kindle, nor any PDF that is uploaded via USB-C. Furthermore, the settings and features for PDF reading are different depending on the method of upload. There are videos online that walk you though these differences if you want to dig into this. I find this inconsistency very frustrating.4) Exporting Limitations - You can only export via email (not directly to any online storage services, and exporting via email does not save any previously used email addresses, other than the quick send address. This is an issue for many of the specific send-to email addresses, which tend to be long and time consuming to type every time. For example, the email address to send documents to Day One journal is 50+ characters long. I should be able to type this once and have it saved as a previously used address to avoid having to retype every time. Additionally, the export PDF has gigantic margins and doesn't make use of the full page.5) Notetaking Limitations - Many other reviews already mention the half-baked note taking as the most significant defect, and I agree. The Notebook options are missing nearly every useful tool from other note apps. For example, copy/paste, lasso to move notes, inserting pages, pressure sensitivity, navigation options (e.g., table of contents, page overview, scrubbing, etc.), and reordering pages are all missing. The most annoying missing feature is the ability to use your own templates, which I used extensively in Goodnotes for things like meeting notes, morning pages, etc.6) OCR / Search - There is no OCR and no handwriting search. This is a really important feature to being able to locate notes, especially given the limitations in navigating Notebooks. Notability and Goodnotes for iOS are great examples of how this should work, and Amazon needs to build this feature into the Scribe software. For now, I have to export everything to a third-party service to make notes searchable.7) Annoying toolbar - The annotation toolbar dropdown is way to big and cannot me moved out of the way. You can only remove it completely (making annotation impossible) or move it to the other side of the screen. Furthermore, it's a big circle that is filled-in, which is distracting. This should be less obtrusive and able to be put in the corner of the screen.8) Difficult to switch documents - There is no way to quickly open recently access documents or books. So, if you are reading a PDF that cannot be annotated or a Kindle book, you can only access your Notebooks by exiting the PDF/Book, navigating to the Notebooks tab, and finding the note you are looking for. There should be a swipe up gesture that shows all recently accessed items, so you can quickly flip from a Book/PDF to the note. This is important given the limitations put on which items you can actually write on.I will use this for a couple more weeks before making the keep/return decision. I'd like to see how quickly Amazon pushes out updates to fix the bugs and add basic missing features.",https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Scribe-the-first-Kindle-for-reading-writing-journaling-and-sketching/product-reviews/B09BS26B8B/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1

I have loved my Kindle Oasis so was excited to have the option of an e-ink notebook from someone tried and true, especially because I wasn't sure how much use it would actually get. In a lot of ways my faith was not misplaced. The tablet feels sturdy, the interface is intuitive and easy to use and everything I like about my Kindle (the readability, the library, etc.) is effective. I've had this about a month and use it all the time but as much as I'm enjoying it, in some ways it makes me regret not taking the risk on another company. It turns out an e-ink tablet/notebook really is an amazing addition to my professional technology arsenal and the hardware here doesn't disappoint, but while I expected some fewer features and less bells and whistles then competitors the notebook capabilities here are missing some really fundamental basic things that are necessary for anyone like me who is hoping to use it as their primary notetaking device/format. I want to be able to recommend this to others who are looking for an e-ink tablet and some updates (which I still hope are possible with software updates) are necessary before that is possible.Pros:- Its a joy to write on, the pen/screen combination is really nice to use even for a cursive user then me.- The eraser function on the premium pen works great.- I love being able to use it both for kindle book reading/pdf annotation and notebooks switching between these functions is easy- The battery life has been very good for me and that ""always ready"" capability was a key reason I wanted this in addition to an iPad.- While there aren't a ton of templates the available templates are easy to use and meet my needs well.- The screen is great for reading, I wasn't sure I'd like the bigger size but its been great, especially for comics/cookbooks and pdfs.- Writing on pdfs worked really nicely and my notes were easy to read afterwards which is a huge plus for me.Notebok must haves: These are the things that would make me want to change my rating and not regret buying this over a competitor. They are ""pressure points"" that I frequently come across while using the Scribe.- There needs to be some way to navigate through a notebook without just flipping through pages. If you only use it for taking notes that will build in order (like to-do lists) the Scribe is fine but a potentially large notebook by swiping through pages is quickly unwieldy. There are a lot of ways this could work: you could allow people to create tabbed sections in a notebook, labeled bookmarks that you can jump to, or subject tags.-There needs to be ways to add pages in particular parts in a notebook  or a way to re-organize your pages. If you think your done with one note section and need to extend it or you want to put new related notes to a previous set of notes you are out of luck, whatever you add has to go to the end always.-  You should be able to add pages from different templates in a single notebook. I think it is very common to have a workflow that would include a to-do list, a blank page for mind mapping or wire framing and lined pages for notes. If they gave us the ability to add pages choosing the template would be great.These three features are basic features I'd expect to have in an e-notebook and the key things that generally make them more functional than paper notebooks.- I don't mind not being able to write on kindle books, which I know is a concern of others, and I thought the handwritten post it style notes worked well but I'd like to be able to access my handwritten notes on other devices (like the kindle computer app) when I'm working.I'd like to have: these things would be nice in a perfect world but I wouldn't need them to be happy.- I'd love to be able to pull up highlights, sections or notes from a Kindle book while in a notebook. I do research and being able to look at highlights from the book in a smaller window (like the one you handwrite notes in when in the Kindle book) while in a notebook would be amazing for researcher or students.- Some form of searchability within a notebook, even if its tags, would be really helpful.- It needs to be easier to get pages from notebooks off the Kindle Scribe to be shared/used elsewhere.If your primary goal is to have a larger sized e-reader with some pfd marking up capability this is a great device 5/5. If you, like me (who pre-ordered it when they were vague about notebook capabilities) were primarily interested in an e-ink tablet for notetaking and was excited to have it combined with an e-reader I'd wait for an update, which after saving up for this one I'm hoping will be via software so early adopters aren't left in the cold.",https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Scribe-the-first-Kindle-for-reading-writing-journaling-and-sketching/product-reviews/B09BS26B8B/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1
Unknown,R3A1OUWGQ3O9A0,Positive,"Amazon Kindle Scribe (16 GB) - 10.2” 300 ppi Paperwhite display, a Kindle and a notebook all in one, convert notes to text and share, includes Basic Pen",4.3,5.0,"8,079","I struggled with the decision to purchase the new Kindle Scribe.  I have had several kindles (going all the way back to the Kindle with a keyboard) and a few Kindle Fires.  I currently have a Kindle Paperwhite and Fire 8 plus.  I have always valued the reading experience on kindles along with the ability to have access to a library of books, obtain samples of books, and a convenient way to highlight and add sticky notes.  I was initially excited to see the Scribe come out, but the price and some negative reviews really gave me pause.  At the urging of my spouse as a Christmas present and convincing myself that I would return it if it didn’t meet my expectations I decided to take the plunge.  I am so glad I did.  It has exceeded my expectations in all three of my must haves.  I decided to write this review in hopes of helping others going back and forth about whether to purchase it now or wait for a future update.As a little background, I am in academia.  I decided that I would purchase and keep the Kindle Scribe if it did an excellent job with The following.1)  Able to read textbooks and technical books with tables, charts, graphs, and math.2)  Able to read pdfs.3)  Able to write notes (lecture notes, answer keys, personal research notes, etc.)Based upon the previous reviews, I was not confident that the Scribe would do a great job with all three of the above must haves.  However, it does.  I’ll take each one separately with my pros/cons and fixes.1) With my previous kindles (including my current paperwhite and Fire), I was never able to have that wonderful reading experience when it came to textbooks and/or more technical books which included tables, charts, graphs, and math.  The physical size of the previous kindles simply was never going to work well with these types of books, even with the zoom feature.  The size, and perfection of the screen, of the Scribe makes reading these types of books just as enjoyable as reading a book of fiction.  The technical stuff comes across wonderfully and there’s no funky formatting that the previous kindles would have when it comes to tables, charts, etc.  So, the Scribe passed with flying colors when it come to this must have.  In response to some other reviews, I will say that I’m actually glad that I cannot write (make notes, underline, circle) on the books themselves.  I like writing a sticky note and highlighting because it keeps the pages less cluttered.  Looking back at physical books that I’ve had to read many times over the years, I have written so many notes in the margins, underlined, etc. that it makes reading them again a pain.  I hope that Amazon will always keep the option of sticky notes even if one day it allows writing directly on the book.  Given the price, did I need the Scribe?  No.  I could’ve just continued to read these types of books as physical books.  But, I am so glad that I can do it on the Scribe and have the wonderful kindle reading experience.  My only complaint is that a few books purchased in the past don’t recognize the pen.  This might just be an issue of needing to reformat all books and hopefully it will be fixed in the future.  Even with those few books, I can still type sticky notes and highlight as before so it hasn’t bee a big deal.2)  Given the size of previous Kindles, sending a pdf and reading it just was never going to work well.  The Scribe does a near perfect job.  Now, having read some reviews, I was really worried about this must have.  I read lots of pdfs from my laptop for my job, and as I sit reading look over to my Paperwhite and wish that I could use it instead (the E-ink is just so much better).  Here’s my take on pdfs, if the pdf is nicely formatted to begin with then it comes across on the Scribe perfectly.  Yes, you can write on it which is nice (kind of wish I could use sticky notes instead though) and easily export it to your email address.  On the other hand, if the pdf is not nicely formatted and/or the text is a bit blurry to begin with, then it doesn’t come to the Scribe perfectly either of course.  I have played around with preparing these troublesome pdfs by cropping or simply changing the margin size before sending and it seems to help, but the text is not as crisp.  Still though, I can read the pdfs on the Scribe just as easily as reading them on my laptop.  So, overall, the Scribe exceeded my expectations here.  One strange thing I’ve come across is that when initially opening a pdf, it opens to a cover page so you have to actually go to the beginning by opening up the toolbar at the top then you can flip the pages.  This is an example of needing to play around a bit with the Scribe to figure out some of the features.  The entire focus on the “cover” thing in pdfs and notes seemed to be a big thing with the tech folks, might be a privacy issue they have in mind.  I realize that some folks, myself included, use Google drive and other web-based options to store documents, but Amazon has done an excellent job of allowing the user to drag and drop a document into the Send to Kindle page/app (and, I make sure to choose the option to send only to my Scribe rather than clutter up all my devices).  I have only tried one Word document so far but it came across perfectly on the Scribe.  If you have a book pdf, you can simply write Chapter 1, 2, etc. on the page of each chapter then go to the notes to easily move to where you want to go.  So, I have been extremely happy with this feature which would’ve been a deal breaker for me.3)  Others have said that writing on the Scribe feels nearly the same as writing on paper and it does.  I plan to write lecture notes, answer keys, and just some notes for myself.  Amazon has done a great job in allowing the notebooks to be easily sent to my email address as pdfs, and they come across on my laptop and Fire exactly has I’ve written them.  I am really, really pleased with this aspect.  In the past, I would scribble an answer key or some notes on a lecture (including Graphs and math) on some scrap paper then a year later when teaching the class again realize that I’d lost the notes and have to redo them.  I will be doing all my writing on the Scribe and storing them for latter use.  Having read some reviews, it sounded like the current software on the Scribe was not up to the competition.  I have to say, however, I am very pleased with the existing software.  You don’t get twenty different widths for the pen but rather five.  I really don’t want to have to choose from a great many, and what they have now is just fine for my needs.  It is true that you don’t have subfolders to create and a large notebook would be difficult to find things in.  I get all of those issues.  However, instead of writing a 100 page notebook I plan to write lecture notes in 10 notebooks of 10 pages in length saved under one folder.  By using appropriate titles for each notebook I think it will actually be better than having one rather lengthy notebook.  There’s not a great many templates to choose from, but I have found the ones currently available work just fine for my needs.  Again, though, the Kindle Scribe exceeded my expectation for writing notes.Overall, I am thrilled with the Kindle Scribe.  I really enjoy the reading and writing experience.  Given the price, did I absolutely need the Scribe?  Not really.  I could read the physical textbooks/technical books.  I could read the pdfs on my laptop.  I could write notes on paper then scan them into my computer.  Or, of course, I could do these things on a good tablet.  However, I have always enjoyed the reading experience on a kindle and the Scribe might be the best yet.  The writing experience on the Scribe is the closest digital device to paper that I have used.  I am glad to have these things on one device which does not have all the distractions that come with laptops and tablets.  I hope this review helps others in making their decisions.  Oh, and as others have said, the battery is amazing compared to tablets and phones.",https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Scribe-the-first-Kindle-for-reading-writing-journaling-and-sketching/product-reviews/B09BS26B8B/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1

It is a first-generation device and, while better versions may come, this one is far from basic.I haven't charged it in a week, in spite of using it multiple times.  I think if you use it heavily for a few days, you will need to charge it more often- but are we really to the point where having to charge a device once a week is a chief complaint?Every single device I have, including a recent phone alleged to be ""top of the line,"" has some loading issues from time to time. It's part of technology and it will never be flawless.There is a learning curve, but once you start to play around with it, it's pretty user-friendly. Simple Google searches answered most of my questions quickly. I encourage you to form your own opinion.CostI got it on sale and traded in an old device to make it cheaper, then am doing the monthly payments for the rest, so I found it all reasonable. Watch for sales and utilize monthly payments to help with costs.ReadingThe reading on this is stellar. If you love Kindles, you will enjoy it. It feels more like a book than a regular Kindle. I have several gadgets I use to prop items up.  The HUANUO portable lap laptop desk (https://tinyurl.com/HUANUO-Laptop-Desk ) is my favorite. I also like laying it flat, like a paper, when I'm reading and writing on PDFs. This might surpass my paperwhite for reading, which is saying a lot since that thing is awesome.WritingI love writing on this. I got the premium pen and love using the ""fountain pen"" setting because it looks beautiful.  I've found it really simple to create notebooks and lists. I like using it for brainstorming so I can still handwrite things, but not waste a bunch of paper, and love the undo feature for similar reasons.  There's also a function to circle and erase a section, which is neat.Book NotesOthers have mentioned not being able to write in book margins, but the notes feature is still nothing to scoff at.  For most books, I can tap where I want to make a note, then either handwrite or type (with the on-screen keyboard), and it will leave a tiny note icon in that spot (which is easy to access later).  This looks cleaner than writing on the book page, while still being functional and simple. A few books still only let you do the old-school Kindle notes, but those aren't bad either.  They are creating more books with writing options.PDFsBeing able to write on and highlight PDFs is a game-changer for grad school, so this is proving to be one of the more helpful features (and part of why I got one). You can adjust the margins of the PDF, depending upon if you want it more for reading or notes.  I took notes on a PDF and sent it back to myself, then later pulled it up on my desktop for my research.Size, Battery, & General FunctionalityThe size is just right, feeling more like a book or paper, while still being condensed. I was able to repurpose an old planner cover for it. As mentioned above, I feel the battery life is impressive, as it tends to be on all Kindles. I've used it for hours on a multi-day road trip without recharging. It's also the first device I can read and write on in a car without getting carsick! As will be the case with most 2-in-1 technology, you might not get every single facet of each one when you combine them- but I do not feel this to be lacking.USE YOUR DESKTOP for set-up/adjustmentsI emailed some PDFs and that went well.  You can also customize your pdf-sending email.  Emailing PDFs to your Kindle email will work for most PDFs and is only limited by your email provider's size restrictions.  For larger PDFs, I tried a few different things and finally settled on connecting my Surface tablet/desktop with the Kindle Scribe. I used a USB to USB-C cord and was able to drag and drop files from any folder on my desktop right into the Kindle documents folder.  This was the fastest and easiest way to send files that were too big for sending via email.I'm glad I bought it and hope others will form their own opinions and get just as much joy out of it. Like any product that is the first of its kind, there is room for growth, but the updates they send through are great and this is still outstanding.",https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Scribe-the-first-Kindle-for-reading-writing-journaling-and-sketching/product-reviews/B09BS26B8B/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1
Unknown,R3EW9N45CTWYJD,Positive,"Amazon Kindle Scribe (16 GB) - 10.2” 300 ppi Paperwhite display, a Kindle and a notebook all in one, convert notes to text and share, includes Basic Pen",4.3,4.0,"8,079","The Kindle Scribe is a pretty neat device. This is my first Kindle device so I was not entirely sure what to expect going into it, but overall I'm really happy I purchased it. Here are some of my impressions of it in the 5 months I have owned it:- Hardware: The build quality of the actual tablet is top notch. The metal casing feels really nice in the hand, and I absolutely love writing on it. I also like the usability of the premium pen, however I am skeptical how long the pen will hold up. Within the first 5 months of me owning, the eraser coating has worn off and it is wobbly. The multi-function side button also is getting loose. The battery life is great, as expected. Generally, I only get 1.5-2 weeks out of mine because I transport it back and forth from work and home everyday, and leave Wifi on at all times. If you turn off Wifi, the battery will last probably twice as long.- Software/Note Taking: The software/UI leaves a little to be desired. It gets the job done, but it's not perfect. Very simplistic with limited functionality. The notes section is good but leaves so much on the table in terms of productivity improvements (i.e. Searching in notes, custom templates, more pen features, cloud sharing, etc.) that some of the ""competitors"" like remarkable and Supernote advertise as having on their devices. I use this as my digital notebook for work, and it does a good enough job for me (I'm a Project Manager, I take notes all day during meetings), but I think true power users who do a lot of sharing and want that extra functionality of using a true digital notebook won't love the Scribe.- E-Reader Capability: In terms of using the Scribe as an e-reader, it is amazing. As I stated, this is my first Kindle, so I don't have prior experience to truly compare to other Kindle models, but I thoroughly enjoy reading on my Scribe. The big screen is equivalent to reading a page on a normal book, and the resolution and e-ink display is easy on the eyes. One of the big reasons I purchased the Scribe is because it has a front light with adjustable brightness and hues. I love being able to read before bed with my bedroom lights off. The Front light is not nearly as harsh as the LED backlights on most displays and doesn't seem to bother my eyes at all. Since I have purchased, I have read 15 books in the first 5 months. Before this, I haven't fully read a single book since my High School AP English class that was over 5 years ago. The ease of use of the Scribe makes it very easy to enjoy content on it. The Scribe is a much better E-reader than it is a digital notebook.Since I purchased mine, I have used it every day and can say I don't have major usability issues with it. Because of this reason, I'm willing to overlook some of it's short comings that I highlighted. However, I couldn't give the Scribe a 5-Star review as the issues that I do discuss (i.e. the Software, and Note taking features) make it an imperfect device. Everything is there for Amazon to make the Scribe a premier digital notebook device, as they have made some fine hardware to go along with their already good e-reader ecosystem. Part of me believes that it isn't Amazon's vision for the Scribe to be a premier digital notebook option, and instead just be a Kindle that you can write with. Nevertheless, I still enjoy my Kindle Scribe and would recommend it to anyone who is looking to use it as a light notetaking device, and also loves to read.",https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Scribe-the-first-Kindle-for-reading-writing-journaling-and-sketching/product-reviews/B09BS26B8B/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1
Unknown,R2096BF8I1SBKX,Positive,"Amazon Kindle Scribe (16 GB) - 10.2” 300 ppi Paperwhite display, a Kindle and a notebook all in one, convert notes to text and share, includes Basic Pen",4.3,5.0,"8,079","*WARNING* I've seen several reviews that are knocking the product because they think it is unnecessary or is lacking some features that Amazon made clear up front would not be available at launch. I feel that is unfair. Overall, this is a quality-built product that embodies all of the great features we love about Kindle, while adding a beautiful note-taking capability. I purchased this product out of my own pocket and this is my unbiased review of the product. If you're still curiou, read on.I have always loved the Amazon Kindle. When I heard about the release of the Scribe, I pre-ordered mine right way, and it even arrived a day earlier than the release date! From a Kindle perspective, it embodies all of the great features Kindle-users have grown to love. It has a big, back-lit glare free screen, which is beautiful for reading. The size, weight and layout is similar to the Oasis and it has a premium quality build and feel to it. The back is a smooth metal and it feels very sturdy in-hand. The battery life seems extraordinary, as is the case with most Kindle products. Mine has been in standby mode with the screen illuminated with a book cover for over 12 hours and remains at 100% charge.They call it the Scribe because users have the ability to write in it as well. Due to copyright issues I'm sure, you can't exactly write on the pages of the book, but you do have the ability to create hand-written notes similar to a sticky-note, which you can access in multiple ways for review. What is cool, is that Amazon includes a ""notebook"" feature that allows you to create notes or drawings that are separate from the Library/reading portion of the Scribe. The notebook is accessible from the home screen. You have the option for various page styles (i.e. wide-ruled, college-ruled, blank, etc.). In conjunction with the included stylus pen, this is where the Scribe really shines! The note taking capability is phenomenal. It does feel like writing with a pen on a piece of paper. Note-taking is smooth and seamless. The stylus has virtually no delay and was truly a satisfying experience. The fact that I can carry this around with me and use it to take hand-written notes, while still having access to my full Kindle library is awesome. I have the Amazon Fire HD 10 Plus tablet, and regardless of the stylus pen or note-taking app chosen, have not had nearly as satisfying of an experience writing and taking notes.Now let's talk about the stylus pen itself. There are two versions. I opted for the Premium Pen, which includes an eraser on the top of the pen as well as a programmable shortcut button. The pen is battery free, so you never have to worry about charging it. It feels good in the hand and as already stated, writes phenomenally. I did find that the positioning of the shortcut button on the Premium Pen is a little unfortunate. If your hand favors a lower grip on the pen when writing, the tendency will be to bump the button. Depending on what feature you have programmed as the shortcut (i.e. highlighter for example), it could become a nuisance. I would have preferred to see it a little higher up on the shaft of the pen. Outside of that, the fact that you can switch between pen mode and highlighter with the click of a button is super convenient. The eraser works well, though there is a slight delay between erasing something and it disappearing on the screen. I also found that when using a lined paper notebook for notetaking, the eraser seemed to eliminate the lines along with what I was erasing. Perhaps that will be fixed in a software update. Keep in mind that there is also an ""undo"" button onscreen that would be better utilized than the eraser for quick eliminations. Overall, the Premium Pen is nice, but probably not necessary. There are enough built-in features on screen to accomplish the same functions, albeit probably not quite as quickly.One of the biggest questions I had about the Scribe was going to be whether or not it would accommodate left-handed users. Most of the pictures and videos show the Scribe being used by right-handed people, i.e. the unutilized portion of the screen where you hold it is on the left side. Thankfully, like most tablets and phones these days, the Scribe has a built-in gyroscope, so simply rotating the device allows the screen to reorient into the proper position. This means I can hold it with my right hand and write with my left hand without issue. This may be a feature that the newer version of the Kindle possess, but my experience has been with the older version of the paperwhite, which did not have this ability.Final thoughts. If you love the Kindle and you're looking for something you can read on and take notes, then this is the device for you. Can you accomplish the same thing from a tablet? Yes. Higher end tablets like the iPad are definitely contenders, especially considering the price of the Scribe. That being said, if you don't need or want all of the apps and features that tablets offer, the Scribe is a great alternative. There are no distractions. No temptations. Just pure an uninterrupted reading and notetaking. It's a beautiful reading and writing experience that is only going to improve as Amazon improves its capabilities in the coming months. Remember, the Scribe has been on the market for a solid 24 hours at this point! While it is on the pricier side, Amazon is giving you 20% off with a trade-in of an older Kindle model. That's a pretty unbelievable deal considering the Scribe was just released (and the trade credit worked during pre-order too). Overall, I'm extremely satisfied with this product so far. Thanks Amazon for another amazing product!",https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Scribe-the-first-Kindle-for-reading-writing-journaling-and-sketching/product-reviews/B09BS26B8B/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1
Unknown,R32M8NPV9ITHEL,Positive,"Amazon Kindle Scribe (16 GB) - 10.2” 300 ppi Paperwhite display, a Kindle and a notebook all in one, convert notes to text and share, includes Basic Pen",4.3,5.0,"8,079","First impressions review: I hesitated to get one of these when they first came out, because I couldn't see a use for it. But recently this year I took up a spiritual tradition (Buddhism) that requires a fair amount of study. As I was slogging through another text that was one abstract philosophical concept after another, I thought to myself, ""You know, maybe I would get more out of this if I could take notes."" Then my teacher recommended some ancient texts to read. He said they were meant to be read and digested slowly. Another case for being able to take notes.So, given my long love affair with Kindle, I suddenly had an excuse to try the Scribe. It's expensive, but I scraped together the money from my discretionary savings and purchased the refurbished version which is good as new.Wow wow wow I love it.First, that boring text I was reading? Infinitely more interesting and engaging for me to take notes as I go. When I have longer notes, I have a notebook I created that is dedicated exclusively to that book. The pen is really fluid and captures the exact idiosyncrasies of my handwriting. It really feels like writing on paper, which is such a therapeutic feeling for me. Already I feel like I'm getting more out of my reading and applying it to my own life. And I love that I can review my highlights and sticky notes in summary at any time. This has been transformative to my spiritual life. So if you like to study religious or spiritual texts I can't recommend it more highly.I also read a lot of non-fiction in general, from self-help to popular science, and I can imagine I'm going to get so much more out of my reading now that I can engage more deeply with the text. This is in contrast to how I would just rapidly consume these books in the past without really absorbing their lessons.So I got what I was hoping for out of this tool, but what I didn't expect was to be able to use it in so many other ways. Since I got the thing (only two days ago!) I have created several more notebooks, including a folder for all my Buddhist studies (including a notebook where I just write down questions I want to ask my teachers.) I created a freewrite journal to write my daily gratitude and set my intentions for the day or reflect at night. I created a work folder for me to jot down general notes during work. And I created a fiction folder for me to work on developing my novel in progress.The charm of this little machine is that you can organize all your notes about everything in one place. Until now, I have all the time been scribbling things down on random pieces of paper or in one of twenty different notebooks. With my ADHD I am all but guaranteed to lose important thoughts because I can't remember where I put them.But now - I only have one place to look! Nothing will get missed. I put it to the test yesterday because my Teams wasn't working at work, and I ended up having to take notes shorthand during a meeting. And those notes were waiting right there for me at the end of the day to review and create tasks.Finally, like the Oasis and the Paperwhite Signature, the Scribe has a dark mode, and it is a lot of fun to write with glowy handwriting in bed. I really enjoy recapping my day in the dark before drifting off to sleep. It almost makes me feel like a kid again, scribbling in my journal before bed. Only no flashlight needed.Now, constructive feedback:1. Because this is a Kindle, the UI is not great. Some features are not intuitive to use. It took me forever to figure out how to change the pen width, another forever to figure out you can add a page to a notebook just by swiping right. For the person that said you can't change page templates within the same notebook, you can - you have to go to the page overview grid thing and you can add pages of any template. Had to figure that out too.2. I don't love that notebooks are interspersed with books in My Library. There should be two separate categories IMO but then they couldn't advertise I guess.3. If you are going to use a lot of sticky notes I suggest getting the premium pen, hiding the toolbar and setting the shortcut to sticky note. Now you don't have to look at the toolbar while you read.4. I really wish there was a way to attach a notebook to a book, creating a shortcut for access, for longer notes that don't fit inside a sticky note. Either that or have infinite space in a sticky note.5. I bought the 64GB and it appears they sent me the 30GB but I have already written too much to send it back without losing all my notes. Hopefully I will not run out of space!6. I really don't know how this would work as a primary work tool. With my work, which is very detail oriented, I really can't write all my notes by hand. Typing is much more comprehensive. But the Scribe is great in a pinch where you need to write something short, like a reminder or phone number, or you have no other option. So I am using it at work for anything where I would normally use a pad of paper, but not when I would use a computer keyboard.Update: This little device has turned into one of my most treasured writing tools. As a fiction writer I really didn't imagine how much it would break open my creativity. It took me back to my childhood days when all I had was a pad of paper and a pen to write down my stories. Now I find myself coming back to the Scribe over and over when I need to work out a plot problem, or sometimes when I just don't feel like staring at a computer screen. I've composed many rough drafts of scenes, I've worked through themes, I've written outline sketches, it's just my catchall tool for figuring my books out. And for some reason it has massively accelerated the pace of my writing, particularly how quickly I am able to problem-solve when I get stuck. Something about the tactile freewrite experience really opens up my creativity in a way that staring at a blank computer screen does not. If you are a writer like me, I urge you to consider it!",https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Scribe-the-first-Kindle-for-reading-writing-journaling-and-sketching/product-reviews/B09BS26B8B/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1

This review will go over regular tablets and 2 other brands of eink note taking devices. I touch on storage, pens, the paper templates, DRAWING...its a lot but def worth looking over. Might as well scroll down to the see more for my review and pull it all up now before you continue any further lol...i really hope this helps somebody on one of the things i mention.Ok I'm going to hit a few topics that I've noticed nobody has really hit on yet, and its something I had tried to find out myself before I bought mine, and I couldn't get that info so I just bought it! I should start by saying I currently have these other devices as well: 10in Samsung tablet, 10in IPad, fire tablet, almost every paperwhite, likebook ares eink tablet, onyx boox nova color eink tablet....and now the wonderful Kindle scribe! Now, let's talk business.I love to read, and the paperwhite has been my go to device all the time hands down for my reading...waterproof, lots of storage at 32 GB and great battery life! Reading comics however is a pain. To small, have to pinch and zoom....just to much hassle. It's the same thing on my other two eink devices, there is still no glare on these other 2 (likebook and boox), you get the min storage but can add micro SD cards, and those are not waterproof and the batteries run down so quickly even when in airplane mode. Now let's talk actual tablets (Samsung, Ipad, fire, etc)... obviously bigger screens, bright vivid colors. Have to install kindle app to read your books (except for on fire tablets), and now you can no longer purchase any new books on these devices unless you are using an actual Amazon brand device when buying them! Comics are much easier to read...and again  in color. You won't be able to read on your screens outside though, the sun will just bounce off device making it more useful for a mirror!! All of these devices will let you surf the web, shop, play games, listen to music or books, read...you name it. Books won't eat up too much of your storage since it's just words but comics sure will. And I don't know about you all, but my batteries on these devices drain faster then say a paperwhite.Here's what I wanted to know-Not only do I read a lot, but I'm an artist. I love to just be able to pull something out of my bag and draw if the mood hits. I noticed people only touched on the ""note taking"" abilities on the scribe...but I wanted to know MORE!! I wanted to see the pen line thickness for each option, see if when you did the  highlighter over the pen if the black would fade, what other pens could be used on it, if we could install more paper options for free directly into notebook paper options!!Let's talk tablets first for drawing and doodling. Fire tablets don't offer to many great drawing apps for people who like to draw. There's sketch guru and sketchbook abd a few just bare min basic apps. But I'm not overly impressed with how they run on these devices and what they offer. Samsung which is android has a bunch due to playstore (I'd list them all but I'd be here all day) art rage, sketch guru, ibis paint, sketch book...a lot. And Ipad, do I even have to say it lol, one word... Procreate! The great things about creating art on these tablets is that you have unlimited color options, shading abilities, tools like shapes and rulers, layer of pages, pens, pencils and brushes etc. I however, and this is me personally lol, don't like drawing on them ( I have, but not since I got my first eink reader and note device) my lines are all over the place, if I have to pick my pen up it's time consuming to get back on the same line I left off its just a flat out pain and it annoyed me! To some they found tricks and have mastered it...not me though lol...give me pen and paper and some color and im good!As for the eink devices. My ares likebook was my first with the ability to write on it. Sure I download my kindle app (but I never really read on it, used paperwhite everytime for that). I was able to access Google playstore, install all the same apps I had on Samsung tablet, could surf web, and do all the stuff I could on Samsung, fire and Ipad. Drawing on apps installed from playstore was horrible on this device. It lagged and I'd have to wait for my line or what I just drew to appear to continue to even draw. Now in the notebook section though it was amazing! Just like pencil or pen to paper, and it's pressure sensitive. The likebook only has 2 pen options, a ballpoint pen and a calligraphy pen. It gives you a few thicknesses to use however the thickest option isn't even as thick as say for example, a Crayola marker tip. The eraser function has the ability to erase entire area, each individual line by just tapping a line to erase, circling an item to erase. It also has gray, red and blue scale options when using pen but those are a joke because I never even noticed a difference, it was still just well, black!! Next device was my boox nova color eink device, all the above for likebook is exactly the same except for when I was in the notebook area, the options are 100% different and better. As far as pen option, you can pick between ballpoint pen, marker, pencil, highlighter, calligraphy pen, and a paintbrush! Yeah I know awesome right?! You can convert your written notes to text, move and drag items, layer, change templates, it has shapes like circle, square, line, etc. Honestly, it does a lot and it's in COLOR!!! Mine has 18 colors. I was so excited for this BUT I'm not overly impressed. I can't shade or blend using any said brushes or any of the colors. It literally just changes to color selected and thats it. If I draw a picture say like a caricature in black and then fill it in with colors, my black Baseline just disappears, even when using the highlighter, so then I have to go back in and redraw my lines which is a pain. And yes, I know, these devices are more so for taking notes not necessarily for drawing. I get it lol, but do you realize how sweet it is to have 1 device that does it all; day or night, inside or out?! It allows me to carry a lot less in my purse just bust something out because I want draw suddenly lol! The one really neat thing about both the ares and the boox, they have several different types of paper patterns and themes to pick from pre installed but they also allow you to download other ones too and add them right to your notebook. Like budget trackers, or savings tracker, shopping list or booklist, planners, goal setting worksheets, blank comic book pages!! It's endless, you want it, you can get and get it for free!! And you can make each page a different paper in your notebook! Believe me when I say this, but that is a huge convenience!Now onto the scribe. I enjoy reading in this which is surprising because I'm so used to the size of my paperwhite, which since getting my scribe, has been retired 😅.  If you're familiar with the paperwhite then you'll notice it's pretty much the same just a much bigger screen. As far as comics go, they are incredibly clear and very easy to read without any eyestrain (you'll just have to make do with the Grayslake colors, but you'll be OK I promise)! I went for the 64GB because I plan to draw, a lot, on this bad boy. I have 32 GB on my paperwhite and have over 4,000 (closer to 5,000 with no signs of stopping) books on that and a chunk of them are comics (like the walking dead com. sets) and I haven't even used so much as half of my 32GB on that. So it didn't even put a dent in my scribe storage of 64GB! Just like all of Amazon's ereaders this is a distraction free device...no apps, no emails or games or whatnot. I'm fine with that in fact i actually prefer that. After I install any new books I tend to keep all my devices in airplane mode (stretches out my battery life even longer). Ok so let's talk about drawing on the scribe. You get one pen with 5 thicknesses to pick from, a highlighter with 5 thicknesses, and an ereaser with 5 thicknesses to pick from plus an option to erease page or an option to circle what you want to erase for it to erase. That's is folks. No extra fancy tools or other pens, no write to text or layering or dragging and moving items or resizing or copy and paste...yet. Maybe one day. You get like either 12 or 15 styles of paper to pick from, however that one notebook will be that style of paper throughout. Page 1 can be lined but then so will every other page in that notebook until you create another notebook. It's annoying, but I just pick a paper I want for a drawing like say I need gragh or dot, select do my drawing, then go in and change it to blank so the next page is blank as well as the paper under what i just drew. I do wish they had a planner (free lol), savings tracker, shopping list, a booklist...cmon at least a book wishlist its a kindle haha! I also really wish that like my other 2 note taking eink devices you could install other paper options into the notebook paper selections...but you can't. You get what  you get unless you buy a planner through keys2success starting at $25 and going up to $150! Anyways, back to drawing, sorry. So this is exactly like drawing on paper!!! Unlike my other 2 eink devices it is NOT pressure sensitive. If you pick up your pen you can very easily pick up right where you left off which I always had a hard time doing on Samsung, ipad and fire. So the the thicknesses of pen options: heavy is just like using a Crayola marker, nice thick bold line. Thick is like a sharpie. Medium would be like a felt tip pen and is less bold then previous two. Then the last two would be like a ballpoint pen or a calligraphy pen, and you last option would be like a very fine tip micro pen. I use these last two pens for all my fine detail and some of my ""ink shading"" if you will. It works amazingly and I'm really picky about pens on these devices and how they preform. Im quite surprised since in videos i watched it seemed bare min compared to my boox. Amazon has not let me down! Pressure isn't an issue because of the sizes they offer in pen options, you just have to use them properly. The highlighter, ok, I AM IMPRESSED! If I highlight over anything I've drawn with it...my black baseline remains, I can't believe it. I'm sold lol! So yeah you won't lose any of your work when you highlight. So it has roughly the same thicknesses available it just doesn't get as fine as the pen options. Think of the thinnest highlighter you've seen and we'll that's the smallest it'll go. If you, say color in something in with the highlighter, and then say use it again in just one area you've colored already to try and make it a little darker, it won't. The eraser thickness options are just like the highlighter, you can't erase just one thing because it may wipe out a larger area but the undo and redo buttons are great for quick mess ups. I tried using the eraser at its finest tip for highlights in hair and well...that didn't work out so well, it erased big areas. Kind of wish they had a micro eraser available for that. The eraser does have the circle to erase option, so I guess you could circle say like and eye or part of the eye to erase that way. They also have an erase page option. I use the undo and redo buttons a lot lol. I really enjoy drawing on this even  though I don't have all the features I have at my fingertips with boox notebook. Do I wish scribe had these features, absolutely! It'd knock those big ticket items right out of the park. I have no issues using the smaller pens to shade and detail and then use the highlighter to really pop those features in my drawings I want to stand out. I'm not gonna address the note taking other than  by saying it's crisp, clear, and your letters are all connected and not cutoff and hands down the BEST note taking device I have when it comes to handwriting. The size is absolutely perfect for everything I use it for. I can't wait to see what features and pens they have on future updates for my scribe, and I really hope that they add more paper options (FREE paper options lol) to our notebooks. You can however send pdfs of different paper to your scribe, but its a pain and not convenient. It gets added to your library and its just 1 sheet when you may need several so it kind of stinks that way. And I don't know about anyone else but I want all my notes and drawings located in one spot, not mixed in with my books and in my library. That would make my Scribe the ultimate all in one tool! I'm fine without color because sadly eink color isn't quite there yet for me. I do own several EMR pens (of course lol) as well. I have the ones that came with my boox and ares, I have the lammy pen, the Norris steadlier jumbo pencil, wacom pens, the heart of metal pen (has a ceramic nib that never needs to be replaced) and the premium pen for the Scribe. Here's what I've found out, all of these pens/stylus work on the Scribe thankfully. I will not use my heart of metal on my Scribe but I'm sure it will work. I'm just nervous because the nib is hard and I don't want to scratch or ruin my screen ( if you're crazy enough to try it ha ha let me know how you make out!). And Although some of these nibs are different sizes it does not effect the size or width of the lines you draw or write with on the Scribe.I'm sorry this review is so long. I just couldn't get this info myself when looking into to purchasing it and no one said anything about drawing on it, pens, or did side by side comparisons. I watched a lot of YouTube reviews and read all the comments and still didn't find what all I wanted to know lol so I really hope.this helps someone else. I am obsessed with my Scribe, between reading and drawing...it's the only one I'm carrying on me at all times and using at home. My other expensive over priced eink note taking tablets are now sitting on a shelf in my room. I think with new updates they launch its just gonna get better and better and it's pretty damn awesome already. Great battery life (nothing i own can ever beat amazons paperwhite and now scribe battery life), lots of storage and I mean lots, great clear clean writing and drawing experience and EVERYTHING is crisp on the screen. If you're on the fence just jump off and buy it already, you won't beat the price and I'm honestly surprised it doesn't cost more...you won't regret your choice. And if one of the other devices I mentioned sounds better for your needs do that (boox does have non colored eink devices that have same features and everything as the colored eink device. Incase anyone wondered lol). Happy reading, drawing and writing...hope this helps someone!One more bonus side note, I have the kindle fabric case for my Scribe. I was nervous to just toss it into my purse and keep it there on a daily basis just in it's kindle case. I did a lot of searching for an additional measure of safety and found this nifty universal bag/case on Amazon. Type in FINPAC tablet case in search bar. This case is extremely useful and just excellent! It has a front pouch which I store an extra battery charger, my cords, all my stylus', my magnetic head attacents for cords (another Amazon buy...and if you don't have these kinds of cords yet you seriously should check them out. I have a combo pack so my cords are from 3 ft up to 10ft, got several sets of each kind of head...micro, c type, apple...and my cords where heads attach actually rotate 360 degrees so ny cord wont bend and break. Best of all, i leave the actual head nib in my devices and it saves all my devices charging ports because over time they tend to get loose and then your device wont charge. Its a life/device saver. Check them out, trust me lol!) and replacement nibs, a wallet, chapstick and my keys lol...just in the front pouch,the only pouch! The large tablet portion has reinforced corners so it's extra protection for your device, it has a soft velvet type material inside over a thick foam type material. The gray fabric also has a diamond type stitching, which one wouldn't think a big deal but, that actually helps to eliminate even more pressure that may be put on your device! It also comes with a shoulder strap so you can just take this as your bag and go, but the strap can also be removed. It has a handle on the back of case if you'd prefer to just carry it that way as well. Right this minute I'm using it as my actual purse since it has exactly what I want and need anyways ha ha, but if needed to I can just remove the straps and still toss it then in an actual purse and go! My Scribe still fits in this bag nice and secure with the case on and the stylus in the loop! Like I said, looked into an extra layer of protection for my device, many were going to be too big and my device would slide around which I didnt want, or else it'd be way too tight in there. Many cases I saw,  the protection of padding either just has foam with mesh looking more like a sponge, or just that soft velvety lining, this one had that stitching which just helps even more to absorb any shock or to distribute pressure evenly or eliminate it all. I did see just another case, it was a case sleeve only, it was black with the inside having the padding with black small circles which would also do really well for our device (sorry forgot the name🤦‍♀️) but I just overall love the functionality of this particular bag/sleeve. I am soooooo pleased with this, and it does the job great. The outter material is scratch resistant, and waterproof and the zippers work and are made with great quality material. If you're looking for an extra great layer of added protection or just an easier way to take it with you, check it out. FINPAC 11in tablet case, it was a prime item, and Amazon's choice, and i got mine the very next day after ordering! I want to say it was $23.99. Great buy and a must have if you're like me and plan to take it everywhere with you!****UPDATE ABOUT KINDLES LATEST SCRIBE BRUSHES UPDATE***OMG!!! Amazon hit it out the park with the brushes!!! This is my ONLY let me stress this fact ***ONLY *** eink device that actually let's you use the pencil feature like a real a pencil, meaning you can even use the sides of your stylus to shade. You now even have pressure abilities as well!! The 5 pencil options are like almost going from like an h to an 8b type pencil (which is just a fancy term for hardness in lead and darkness lol for the non artist out there) but man they did such and incredible job with the pencil feature. I'm stunned!!! Wasn't expecting that! I'm also loving the fountain pen as well, it's insane. My boox color has all of these BUT for some reason when I compare them my scribe is sooooo much h better.  And like I said whennit comes to the pencil none of my eink devices have the ability to use the side of the stylus of the abilities to shade as well as it does on the scribe even though they too are pressure sensitive. Amazon nailed it with the brushes on this update! Now hopefully they add some tools, shapes like lines, circles, etc.; layering, copy and paste, lasso to resize and move and image around on page, being able to change paper selections in notebooks would be HUGE too! This is truly become my all in 1 go to device and Amazon has and the kindle have become and huge part of my life and I haven't strayed...when I have I haven't been to pleased and always seem to come back lol only to place the others on a shelf to sit and collect dust. My battery is still going off of only a 2nd charge and I got at xmas and use it everyday for about 6hrs a day (I know a bit extreme ) sometimes I am on wifi but I try to keep it on airplane mode a lot to save my battery.  It's a GREAT device and I am obsessed even more now with the update lmao!",https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Scribe-the-first-Kindle-for-reading-writing-journaling-and-sketching/product-reviews/B09BS26B8B/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1
Unknown,R1FAN1GREL5DB,Positive,"Amazon Kindle Scribe (16 GB) - 10.2” 300 ppi Paperwhite display, a Kindle and a notebook all in one, convert notes to text and share, includes Basic Pen",4.3,4.0,"8,079","Ah, the joys of a new Kindle! Turn it on and the familiar typeset, newsprint, fountain pen and ink screensavers evoke the days of analog living. I could almost smell the inked paper when I powered up my Kindle Scribe for the first time. Sound familiar? Read on, this quirky new Kindle may be for you.Like many avid Kindle users, I embrace the hints of atmosphere, elegance, and craftsmanship of days gone by, without having to give up the ease modern technology affords. Amazon has always positioned Kindle to beckon to this target market, crafting a distraction-free enclave into which to retreat for the joys of reading. Now if only we could capture the thoughts, ideas, and emotions that reading kindles in our minds (see what I did there?), without having to leave this delightful inner nook!Enter the Kindle Scribe. Not only a portable library of books personally curated to suit your tastes, the Scribe also offers up a clean stack of notebooks, blank pages brimming with potential, spines labeled by content, bottomless sticky notes, and a hardy pen nestled beside them on your virtual bookshelf.And that’s it. The Kindle Scribe is not a tablet, smartphone, or smart anything else. It is a minimalist digital analogue for paper—now not only for reading, but for writing as well.Reviews from users and “experts” I read before my Scribe arrived typically faulted the Scribe largely on the grounds that it is not an iPad or this or that digital notetaking competitor. If you want that kind of comparison, this review is not for you. There are plenty of those already, and I don’t know anything about any of those devices. When I want tablet functionality, I use my tablet. I'm zany like that.Folks seem to miss the point that this is a “KINDLE/Scribe.” It aligns with the Kindle ethos of providing a distraction-free, electronic experience akin to analog that favors simplicity over clutter. Piling the Scribe with excess features would morph it into something else entirely, destroying the Kindle hallmark of cozy enclosure. If you get this, you will likely enjoy the Scribe’s style. If not, you won’t.Here are the top ten things I am enjoying about the Scribe, right out of the box.1. READING EXPERIENCE is flawless, with most Kindle reading features, such as customizing the view by font, size, alignment, reading progress, Word Wise, and the like. Scribe retains 300ppi resolution despite the increased screen space. Landscape and portrait options are available either manually or via gyroscope, depending on content. Magazines, journals, technical books, and those with hefty footnotes are far more pleasing to take in than a Kindle. Pages turn by a touch or swipe with finger or pen (I use the eraser side to avoid wear on the tip).2. INDUSTRIAL DESIGN is masterful. Aluminum case, pleasing to look at as well as slim and a joy to hold, despite the larger size. The sleek case made by Amazon is unintrusive and complements the hardware. The cover wakes and sleeps the Scribe. Origami folds have high and low vertical easel positions.3. KINDLEVERSE. Seamless continuity with my Kindle library, without the need to use an app or third-party software with limited functionality. Borrowed ebooks from library, same. Last page read and non-handwritten content syncs between Kindle devices and apps as usual.4. BATTERY LIFE is Olympic, given the size and functionality. Mine came charged to 61%, and it is still going despite much testing, syncing, reading, markup, and notebook creation. Too early yet for me to gauge how long one charge lasts with normal use. USB-C port for charging is handy.5. WRITING EXPERIENCE is outstanding, and feels very much like paper. The pen scritches satisfyingly as it travels across the page, um, I mean, screen. It is smooth, with no noticeable latency and a few options for a nib thickness, highlighting, and erasing. My handwriting looks like my handwriting. The customizable shortcut button on the premium pen allows easy access to the feature you use most. It does not need a battery and clips magnetically to the side of the Scribe. Any Wacom pen works on the Scribe, and vice versa. You can move the writing toolbar to the left or right, or remove it altogether whenever you prefer an unencumbered space. I have tried the Scribe twice now to take notes continuously during a two hour live translation session. It is a dream, and cost me about 15% battery with lights and all features blazing.6. NOTEBOOKS. So much chatter about dazzling e-note features other, differently positioned devices have and Scribe lacks obscures what is on offer. Eighteen templates: narrow, college, and wide horizontal ruled, each with or without a vertical margin line; vertical ruled with and without header line; blank; square and dot grid; checklist; daily, weekly, and monthly calendars; tracker; storyboard; and sheet music. Naming, storing, and accessing notebooks is easy, and email sharing is a breeze.7. IT’S LIT! Ambient light sensor, warmth settings, and dark mode foster a pleasant, unobtrusively customized experience—akin to having Jeeves hovering in the wings, silently adjusting lamps or lighting candles for your reading comfort.8. AUDIBLE AND TEXT TO SPEECH. I love audiobooks and still miss the text to speech functions of older Kindles. The Scribe offers both, via Bluetooth.9. STICKY NOTES. This feature, used to annotate ebooks, has limitations, but is far more pleasant than keying in notes on a regular Kindle. Notes from one book or document can be exported into a single file.10. LIMITED DISTRACTIONS. No apps. No videos. Barebones internet browser. Basic notebook functionality means it is easy to learn.Just as my first Kindle gave me ready access to a curated library everywhere, the Scribe keeps my notes at my fingertips, even when I am too far—or too lazy—to access my (many, many) notebooks. I’ve even started using storyboards and mind maps because of the available templates. In short, the Kindle Scribe enhances my reading experience through modest writing features that mimic analog usage.Call me crazy, but I think that is implicit in what a “KINDLE/Scribe” is meant to do. I look forward to improvements to make the interface even better.For example, there is no way to customize the Home screen, which devotes far more space to purchase recommendations than my ebooks—Amazon will be Amazon. Some glitches could use attention, like using a back arrow in some areas and a close box in others to move out of a particular function. Landscape orientation activates by gyroscope for some interfaces, and manual selection in others. Moveing the writing toolbar happens within the shortcut, but you have to go to the general dropdown menu to remove it. It is cumbersome to move between ebook to notebook, and impossible to use notebooks while listening to Audible audiobooks. It would be great to send audiobooks borrowed from my public library to the Scribe, like ebooks (a feature that depends on collaboration with library software providers). Amazon Customer Service agents I contacted with questions seemed even less knowledgeable about Kindle Scribe than I am.In addition, I think Amazon would have done well to premiere the Scribe with features that snuggle well with the Kindle spirit. Here is my top five wish list in that regard:1. STICKY NOTES. Currently, sticky notes that happen in Scribe, stay in Scribe. This is the most egregious omission, to my mind. Syncing notes, highlights, bookmarks, etc. across devices is a cornerstone of Kindleness. Yet non-Scribe devices or Kindle apps cannot edit sticky notes. They cannot view them. In fact, they give no indication they even exist. You have to wonder who thought this was okay. Sticky notes need to be accessible across Kindle devices and apps in some way.2. NOTEBOOKS. The notebook system should be robust, with nesting subfolders, using different templates within a single notebook, inserting and moving pages within notebooks, default cover page selection, custom templates, and easy switching between notebook and ebook, audiobook, or PDF/document view. Kindle apps can view notebooks, but I have not find a way to access them on Kindle devices. Add text recognition with search, sort, share, and related functions.3. WRITING. Give me scribble, markup, and highlight options in ebooks, not just sticky notes. Lavish me with pen nib styles, thicknesses, and sensitivity options. Basic drawing too.4. FILES. Let “Send to Kindle” be an option rather than a requirement for e-note functionality in PDFs and documents other than Kindle books.5. WATERPROOF. I often write with coffee, tea, or water beside me. Enough said.Had I paid less, these missing pieces would be less troublesome. At this price point, I don’t want to have to repurchase a new generation in a year’s time. Even with the trade-in discount, the Scribe is twice the price of the Oasis. Apparently, the days when Amazon underpriced its devices to snag a big chunk of the market, or even carve out a new niche, are behind us. I’m not sure how wise this is in a field already populated by similar and successful devices (I’m looking at you, Fire Phone). It seems Amazon took the Scribe market for granted and went lazy on the software. Or perhaps the plan was to release a supersized Oasis and at the last minute, they figured they toss in some writing features, despite being half-baked. Nevertheless, Amazon certainly has the heft to polish an already lovely device into a spectacular one in harmony with the Kindle aesthetic.Interestingly, the sleek climate-pledge packaging features an image of a handwritten note on a Scribe that reads: “Transformation => small consistent changes.” A harbinger of things to come? I like to think so. For now, the Scribe is a delight to use and a welcome addition to my bookish toy box. Don’t let the naysayers with a bone to pick or undue eagerness to gather likes and followers sway you.This is a quirky little cubby for Kindle readers who write. No other device serves this niche this well.Since I have a penchant for naming items that I use often, my Scribe is called Edith, after the “ugly duckling” middle sister of Downton Abbey who blooms into the swan she always was as time softens her rough edges and reveals her many undiscovered merits. Time will tell whether Scribe imitates art …TWO WEEK UPDATE: Endearing is not a word I typically associate with electronics, but without a doubt, I find the Scribe to be precisely that. Despite the lacunae on the enote side of things, the Scribe is such a joy to use that I find new ways to incorporate it daily. Even without welcome upgrades to the software, I already cannot imagine being without the comfortable screen for reading and the surprisingly useful enote functionality. It complements my Voyage nicely and then some. If you are on the fence about the Kindle Scribe, it is well worth giving it a try.ONE MONTH UPDATE: Still enjoying it, though it definitely feels like Amazon was planning to supersize the Oasis and then tacked on the writing features at the last minute and changed the name to Scribe. Enough to get out of the gate, but it could be a truly stellar product with a few adjustments. For Kindle readers who love the feel of pen and paper though, or those who benefit from the larger reading surface, it is hard to beat.On another note, watch for price reductions. On January 6, 2023, barely a month after releasing the Scribe with no discount, Amazon offered about 15% off the various options, including bundles, refusing to credit original purchasers who paid full price. Odd choice for ""Earth's most customer-centric company,"" but there it is. If you are willing to take the chance that Amazon will not undercut the price at your expense shortly after you purchase, go ahead and pay full price. Otherwise, consider a competitor's product or wait until Amazon issues another promotion, nearly guaranteed on Prime Day, if not sooner.NEARLY ONE YEAR WITH THIS LITTLE GEM. The many updates that Amazon has made to the Scrib, including virutal pen nibs (fountain pens! art brushes!), pdf usage, notebook organization, and more, resolve most of the issues I mention in my original review. Still no way to see handwritten notes in Kindles other than the phone app, or even know they are there, or ability to write directly on a page (instead of a note) in Kindle books. But it is less of an issue for me, after the great functionality possible with the Scribe. I use it in ways I never imagined, and have found workarounds for the features that I continue to want.I do hope that Amazon continues to improve it through software upgrades, but I do not regret the (full price!) purchase in the least. Facrot in the substantial savings during Prime Day, Big Deal Days, and upcoming Black Friday sales, and it would be a no branier for me if I had it to do again. Competition from other eink devices does not sway me. This is a Kindle. I am a heavy Kindle user. And a writer. The Scribe gives me the little cubby to make myself comfy in for my reading and writing.So, all in all, if you have a healthy Kindle library, prefer the larger format, and/or enjoy writing with a pen and being able to save your work, this is the eink doodad for you. If you have the budget for it, buy it. I am delighted that I did.",https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Scribe-the-first-Kindle-for-reading-writing-journaling-and-sketching/product-reviews/B09BS26B8B/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1

Unknown,R3IQYE3MBPQYAW,Positive,"Amazon Kindle Scribe (16 GB) - 10.2” 300 ppi Paperwhite display, a Kindle and a notebook all in one, convert notes to text and share, includes Basic Pen",4.3,4.0,"8,079","I have been looking at e-ink writing-enabled devices since the Remarkable 1 came out and could never justify anything more expensive than the Mobiscribe.  When the Scribe was announced, I pre-ordered it, canceled my order and then bought it anyway.  I'm so glad I did!  So why did I almost not buy it?  I'm a software developer by trade as well as a voracious reader and journaler, and let's face it; any first-generation device is going to have bugs.  That's just the way of it.  Overall, I am very pleased with the Scribe and use it for hours every day.  It has replaced paper planners and journals.  The only thing that keeps it from replacing my other Kindles as a reader is that it's a bit big.  However, the size is great for writing, so I'm not complaining.Let's look at it as an e-reader.  It's great.  It's a Kindle.  Amazon has had years to perfect the e-ink reading experience and I expected no less.  Because I read far more PDF's on this device than I did on earlier Kindles,  I have noticed that there seems to be an inconsistency in navigation with PDF's and, more importantly, the writing experience with them.  I address this later in the review.So, the Scribe as an e-writer: it's quite good!  Not perfect, but very good.  Let's look at the three main ways of writing on the Scribe:1) Annotating Kindle books - to the horror of my husband who thinks paper books are sacrosanct and should never be sullied by ink, I underline, highlight and annotate books.  I love buying a used book that someone before me has annotated.  I was initially disappointed that the Scribe does not allow annotating in the margins.  However, I quickly fell for adding handwritten notes to highlights (and the highlight can be minuscule).  It does keep the page clean and the notes can be rather copious.  It also creates a file of notes and their references.  Finally!  I can write in a library book!!2) Using native Scribe notebooks - based on my experience with the Mobiscribe, I thought that I'd use this the most.  I use it hardly at all.  It works quite well, but my beef with it is that, unlike the Mobiscribe, you cannot create your own templates or change page formats in the middle of a notebook.  (Ahem!  Amazon developers!!  I'm looking at you!)3) Annotating PDF's - Oh boy, do I use this extensively!  I buy a PDF notebook from an Etsy seller and happily scribble notes to my heart's content.  Sadly, this area is where the Scribe is the most buggy.  Sometimes (as mentioned above) PDF's simply can't be written on.  This appears to arise from three reasons.  1) the PDF wasn't uploaded correctly, 2) the PDF is in a format that the Scribe doesn't know how to handle, 3) the Scribe locks up.  So, how to fix these issues?First, just get into the habit of sending PDF's to the Scribe correctly.  There are a couple of ways to accomplish this.  1) Use the Send To Kindle web link: https://www.amazon.com/sendtokindle or 2) use the plug-in for Windows or Mac, a link to which can be found on the Send to Kindle page.  I'm lazy and prefer the plug-in.  I right-click on the file I want uploaded in Windows Explorer -> Send to -> Kindle.  It opens a little dialog box which, after the initial log in and choosing Scribe, sends it right to my Scribe.  Done.  Send via the email address?  No.  Send via a USB cable?  No.  Either use the web link or the plug-in and be done with it.2) PDF formatting issues.  I'd love to tell you exactly what the issue is here.  I've seen a couple of potential explanations on Reddit, and mistrust them.  I'm not sure anyone knows for sure right now.  I ran into the issue with a reading journal I bought on Etsy and the seller worked with me until he got it.  I didn't ask him what he changed.  I'm thinking that, at the moment, the Scribe is so new we're all rattling bones at it, hoping to stumble on the magic.  I'm hoping this will be fixed in future software releases.  (Yes, Amazon developers, I'm looking at you!)3) The Scribe simply locks up.  This seems to be an issue for those of us who extensively annotate PDFs.  I suspect a memory leak issue in the software that  gets fixed in a future software release (Yep, one more time, I'm looking at you, Amazon developers).  It could be a hardware issue if the processor chip needs to be more powerful.  The workarounds I've found depend on how badly the thing has locked up.  If the PDF either suddenly can't be written on or if the Scribe throws an error when trying to open a PDF, what frequently works is simply opening a Kindle book and then going back to the PDF.  If that doesn't work, a soft reboot from the top menu will usually clear its little brain and get things going again.  I have had it lock up so hard that the screen doesn't respond to anything.  That means a hard reboot with the switch on the side.  It's irritating to have this happen, but again, this is a first generation device, people!I know this review had gotten to the size of a blog post, and if you've gotten to this point thank you for staying with me.  There's more.There will always be people who complain that it isn't an iPad.  It's not supposed to be an iPad.  You want an iPad, buy an iPad.  The whole point of e-ink devices is that you don't have the distractions of a young full-blown computer.  You read.  You write.  We're done.  To me, the even bigger advantage is that there isn't the eyestrain of a tablet or computer.  You're not staring for hours into light emitted into your eyes.  I'm not knocking tablets.  I was a first generation adopter of the iPad those many years ago and use them happily still.  But for reading and now writing, give me an e-ink device.So, given that I've convinced you that a dedicated reader/writer is a good thing, why the Scribe?  This is trickier.  There are four major brands besides the Scribe, even the cheapest of which has features the Scribe doesn't have.  These four are Remarkable (now on Version2), Boox (and they have several devices to choose from), Ratta Supernote (a few devices), and MobiScribe.  I'd love to say I can review all four brands and compare/contrast.  I've used the Remarkable Version 1 and own both the original MobiScribe and the MobiScribe Origin.  Even the MobiScribe, the cheapest of the four, can do handwriting-to-text which the Scribe can't do (ahem).  So why would I go for the Scribe?  The biggest reason is the Kindle reading experience.  Kindle books can be read on the other devices, but with varying degrees of ease.  Because the Scribe was built by the people who built the Kindle, I expected Kindle books to be far better integrated and they are. At the moment, I'd say the Scribe is a perfect device for dedicated Kindle users.  If, however, you predominantly read PDFs, probably another device would be a better choice.  At least for now.The other reason the Scribe may be a good choice is the power of Amazon behind it.  Let's face it, if Amazon chooses to make the Scribe a success, listens to the early adopters and studies the abilities of the competition, they have the developmental horsepower to make this thing fly.  If, however, this first Scribe is a one-hit-wonder and Amazon decides that the market isn't big enough to justify the development costs, this thing is going to sink like the proverbial stone and I, for one, will be mad as a wet hen.  This is, unfortunately, a real possibility.  The number of consumers who want a dedicated e-ink writer are never going to be as great as those who want a more all-purpose tablet.  Amazon may decide that the e-ink reader market is where they're going to stay.  If that's their decision, I will cry.  Loudly.  Really loudly.If you made it this far, thanks for staying with me.  With all its quirks, I love the Scribe.  I hope you will, too.",https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Scribe-the-first-Kindle-for-reading-writing-journaling-and-sketching/product-reviews/B09BS26B8B/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1
Unknown,R21MQEEMKQFW2K,Positive,"Amazon Kindle Scribe (16 GB) - 10.2” 300 ppi Paperwhite display, a Kindle and a notebook all in one, convert notes to text and share, includes Basic Pen",4.3,5.0,"8,079","So I had already upgraded my Kindle Paperwhite to the New Paperwhite Edition and then as I'm searching the internet for a digital notebook, I get brought back to Amazon to learn of this wonderful invention called The Kindle Scribe!Holy convenience Bat-Man! Now for anyone who is unsure what exactly the scribe is, let me break it down for you...it's a digital E-Ink Notebook/sketchbook that also allows you to read from your kindle library. This is nothing like the Kindle Fire or the iPad at all, so if you were hoping for a tablet that lets you surf the internet, check emails, and watch movies etc, this is not for you.If you're an avid notebook carrier who fears that one day your stuff might catch on fire and you'll lose all of your precious ideas and/or sketches, then this is for you! I had a close call with a journal of mine and then the dread sank in, bringing back PTSD of my floppy disks being ruined or CDs not writing all of the data properly! I never want to go through those days again. So I decided to give this a try. All my notes are saved, backed up, and easily accessible and if my Scribe somehow gets destroyed I'm confident in knowing purchasing another one will have every single note that I took.Now, if you've stayed with me this long, then you're apparently seriously considering buying it. Let me list below the pro's and con's of this Scribe.BIGGEST PRO -PHENOMENAL PEN!!! I'm not kidding ya'll. At first I was curious how well this ""pen"" with a built in eraser would work? Would it be super laggy? Would my handwriting look like garbage? The answer is...NO! I found myself often using the pen so naturally that when I erased something I blew on the page and dusted it as if there'd be eraser shavings! IT FEELS THAT LEGIT! No lags, it's lightening fast, and guess what? YOU CAN REST YOUR PALM ON THE SCREEN AND IT DOESN'T INTERRUPT WHAT YOU'RE DRAWING/WRITING! Needless to say it blew my mind. My friends all took a shot at using it and were having a blast while we waited in line at Disneyland - see the image above for their page full of writing fun. The fact that the pen doesn't need to be charged is also great. How does it work? I don't know, but it does! It also comes with several (4-6 I believe) replacement tips and I've only just started to notice the tip was fraying just a smidge but that's after doing light sketches using the ""pencil"" form of the pen. Have I mentioned how amazing the pen is? I legitimately feel like I am writing on actual paper and I get those lovely little writer tingles when I've finished a page.MORE PROs--You can adjust the number of lines or no lines that you want in each notebook! Wide-ruled, blank pages, normal journal pages, or grid. It also lets you stay organized, easy to go back and forth between notebooks and pickup where I left off.-Brightness is adjustable as well as having blue or orange light! [As someone who often wakes up in the middle of the night with an idea, this has been a great feature for me, so that I can jot the note down without burning my retinas from the blue of the screen]-Feels like paper! Like...I can't explain it. You'd have to try it to understand-You can straight up rest your entire hand on the screen and it won't interrupt your writing or the flow-Eco-friendly! As a writer and as someone who loves this planet, I will say that I often felt bad for buying notebooks because we're just tearing down trees left and right and our planet is suffocating. But nothing beats the feeling of turning a page or running your hands along the spine of a book or journal. But also we should move away from paper made from trees and try some alternatives. I will be using this Scribe until it dies and that will be THOUSANDS of pages later.CONS--Battery life is meh...but I also expected this. My Paperwhite is rarely charged because of how long the battery lasts. So months can go by and I'll pick it up and it'll be at 75%. The scribe is not that reliable. I've had maybe two weeks go by and will notice it drop to 45-ish%. Again, not bad! But not as impressive as other Kindles. But I also use it mainly for writing and not for reading so I'm sure the battery life would last less if I also read on it. Just keep it charged before you travel and you should get at least 2 weeks out of it with light reading and heavy writing.-The screen has frozen about 5 times in the month that I've had it, but NEVER crashed. It would pause, like it was trying to remember what it was doing, but then picks right back up and allows me to keep writing. This isn't a huge issue, but I'm trying to make sure ya'll know everything if you're still considering buying this.-Not a tablet. And I don't want it to be, but I know a lot of people are a wee bit confused as to what the Scribe is and who it's for. The answer is- it's for writers. Would I make an entire presentation on this? Absolutely not. Could I review documents and jot some notes on those for work? Yeah, but also...I have a work computer where I can do that. Will it be useful to have during meetings? YES! Jot down notes quickly and know that you can email them immediately after to everyone else. I believe it has (or if not yet out will have) the function to turn handwriting into typed font and that's just really freaking cool, you guys! I have yet to try it.-It will make you hate your handwriting but encourage you to writer better! I started writing in cursive on this thing because omg it makes my handwriting look so pretty and elegant. Even my friends who tried it out were trying to make their writing look pretty as well and as you can see in the pic above, it's amazing at actually capturing YOUR handwriting. Not something the system tries to match with your pen strokes.OVERALL?This bad boy is a winner ya'll. If  you're serious about switching from paper journaling to digital, you can't go wrong with this scribe. I have weirdly felt MORE creative with it, as I flip to the Kindle Library to look up some quick Mythos references in some of my books and then pop back over into my notes to keep world-building.  Now, once more, I will reiterate: THIS IS NOT A TABLET. This is an E-Notebook. It's a little hefty, but I've never once been afraid of dropping it and it actually makes me hold it like I would a real journal. It's okay to push the pen firmly on the screen and you'll see it reacts exactly like a real pen.If you are able to, I highly recommend getting the Premium Pen which comes with a dedicated eraser. It's much easier to use so I don't have to keep touching the screen to switch from pen to eraser.And...that's all I got. I know it was a lot but I hope it was informative. If ya'll have any questions reach out on here and I'm more than happy to share more of my experiences with the Kindle Scribe. Cheers!",https://www.amazon.com/Kindle-Scribe-the-first-Kindle-for-reading-writing-journaling-and-sketching/product-reviews/B09BS26B8B/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1

The price is *amazing* for its specs, and it is indeed too good to be true. Do not repeat my mistake.It is true this laptop is on the cheaper side - that was half the draw. While $500 is not much in the grand scheme of computers, it is still a lot of money. And, for that amount, it is fair to expect the machine to work properly right out of the box.I purchased this laptop (new) as a gift for my partner, to replace their old ASUS >10 years old. It was not intended for any intensive purpose. Truly, an Internet machine.We just returned it. My partner is upset, my gift to them ruined. I am despondent.Today is Tuesday. The laptop first arrived last Monday, and I completed initial Windows setup so it would be ready to go upon presentation of the gift later in the week. No issues during Windows setup that I could discern, so I replaced the packaging and wrapped it up pretty. Yay!This is where the joy stops.Within 24 hours of my partner receiving and starting to use the laptop (Thursday), it began to blue screen. Over, and over, and over. Even if nothing was running on the laptop.Countless hours my partner spent between Friday and Monday trying to fix the issue. Interestingly, System File Checker found corruptions on this brand new machine. Odd. Anyway, factory resets and Windows 11 re-installs did not stop the BSOD's, which all but confirms a hardware problem. The dump files (countless .dmp files) suggest power/circuitry malfunction. We did everything we could to fix this problem, short of opening up the laptop itself. Additionally, when the laptop was not BSOD-ing into oblivion, it would freeze entirely. WHY? It is new.Perhaps the CPU (Intel) was faulty. I heard about problems with  recent generations, so I went with this laptop that had an earlier (12th gen) CPU. Perhaps the 32GB RAM, which led me to buy this laptop, is cheaply made and caused the problem. Perhaps some other internal defect exists that we could not identify as we did not open up the machine. We'll never know why this was happening, unfortunately, because... The other half of this quandary is that HP restricts access to advanced BIOS settings so you cannot troubleshoot or fix issues. There is no way around it. Perhaps this is to keep an unsophisticated grandma from bricking her laptop. Perhaps this creates artificial necessity for HP's customer service, for which they charge more money. It is deplorable, regardless of the reason.Beyond the defective product, equally concerning is the return policy which states that a percentage (up to 50% of purchase price!) is withheld from the refund if seller and/or manufacturer decide the problem for which you returned the machine doesn't exist, and/or they dislike having to replace the original packaging. Insult to injury: if the laptop doesn't work, YOU MIGHT NOT GET YOUR MONEY BACK after you return it. My purchase was fulfilled through PCOnline US. I reserve comments until I see whether they choose to wrongly deprive me of a full refund. Even so, the policy should be called out as arbitrary, inconspicuous, and unfair to the consumer. When you buy a good, you are entitled to perfect tender. When you do not receive what you paid for, you are entitled to a refund.IN SHORT: A new laptop with these specs should not run this poorly.

Overall, I'm satisfied with these HP17x laptops. BUT!!! There are a couple things to be WELL AWARE of, before buying. First, and FOREMOST. A word of caution! As most everyone knows, Microsoft has, for quite some time, been transitioning truly from a software company into a retail sales company. That fact is abundantly clear! Now, be well aware of what Microsoft has done in its latest versions of WIN11-HOME. Many (perhaps most???, perhaps all???) Windows11-HOME based computers are delivered with the OS in ""S-Mode."" We run HP desktop and laptop computers exclusively, so I can speak only to my several more recent HP purchases. However, I no longer subscribe to WIN11-HOME. All of my recent purchases have been ordered with the WIN11-PRO OS. My advice to those considering buying any computer preloaded with WIN11-HOME: ""stay well away."" ""S-Mode"", does not allow the user to load any 3rd-party software. All software must be obtained (think $$$$$) from the MS Store. While MS claims that the procedure required to exit ""S-Mode"" is quite simple, in fact, we've found that it is nearly IMPOSSIBLE!!! And, it will require the involvement of MS 'off-shore' tech assistance, which is not necessarily easily obtained. One such call that I received, after HOURS of waiting, arrived at 2AM. If buying an HP17x laptop, order with WIN11-PRO. PRO versions are not restricted by ""S-Mode"" software. Now, to the computer. Typical of HP products, this laptop is well built, with an excellent display. Ports are somewhat limited, but, for me, that is not a deal-breaker. I like having the 32GB of RAM, and at least 1TB of storage. I expect these laptops to be more than adequate into the foreseeable future. My one complaint with these, and it is critical, is that the integral cooling system is WHOLLY inadequate. When used for long periods of time, especially on mains power, which we do, these computers will run HOT!!! My take on that is, putting an engineer and an accountant together, on any design project, inevitably results in trouble. In an effort to make this laptop as slim and as light-weight as possible, the internal cooling apparatus has suffered for it. In these, the CPU does generate a lot of heat. The air duct is quite small and narrow, and the internal fan is a joke, except that it's not. So!!! Buy a serious laptop cooler, to go along with your laptop purchase. And, I don't mean one of those multi-fan, USB powered units, that generate heat to remove heat. High quality, AC/DC-adapter powered gaming type coolers are available from Amazon. You'll be happy you made the purchase. At first, battery life is quite short, but we've seen that over time (repeated charge/discharge cycles) battery life does improve some. In our case, having to use mains powered coolers, we simply use mains power for our laptops, and we don't rely much on battery power. Of course, bear in mind that having to have access to AC power does diminish the practicability of using a laptop computer, in the first place. The HP17x series are big computers with a healthy display. One minor complaint is the lack of a backlit keyboard. But, for the money (around $500), these were still a good buy.",https://www.amazon.com/HP-Business-Display-i3-1125G4-Processor/product-reviews/B0C6NC4KRT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1

In general, it meets all of my needs for a business and personal laptop.  However, my expectation was that I could use a docking station to connect to external monitors like my old Dell did.  However, this HP model does not support graphics via its USB-C port.  So, the monitor ports on the 3rd party docking station that I purchased from Amazon don't work.  All the other ports do work as expected.I was able to connect a second external monitor through the docking station by purchasing a Diamond Mutimedia BVU165LT adaptor ($31.78 from Amazon).  It has a built-in Display Link video card to generate graphics and comes with adaptors for HDMI, DVI, and VGA Monitors.  I now run one monitor via the BVU165LT, one through the laptop's HDMI port, plus the internal display.  You can run more monitors by purchasing BVU165LT adaptors for each one.Other than needing the Diamond adaptor for the third display, I am generally pleased with the HP laptop.  As others have noted, it is a good, solid unit.  The battery life has lasted for at least four hours.  It is lighter than my old Dell, which was a real road warrior.

I don't need the latest processor, but I do need on-board storage. I don't game or run AI, I just use office programs, mainly to write. The 1 TB SSD and i3 processor suit me just fine.It does have some frustrating downsides, primarily relating to Windows 11 (Pro). I don't know if these are built into the OS or if it's the manufacturer's implementation. The main frustration is that when I change settings like default font, start menu apps, etc., the changes disappear when I restart the computer--sometimes even during use. Also I can find no way to back up onto a hard drive. Win 11 insists that I use OneDrive. Do they not know that there are still many places where internet is not available? Maybe that's an urban bias. There are lots of places in rural America where you can't even get a cell signal!There seem to be many useful features of Win 10 that have vanished in Win 11. When I search for advice, I find instructions supposedly for Win 11 that reference tabs or links that I don't seem to have. That's not the computer's fault, but it is saddled with an OS that frustrates the dickens out of me.

Sounds great...sometimes has pairing issues, but still everything was good.Then it fell into a hot tub. I say fell because it was sitting on the side and apparently the base made it bounce right into the hot tub. I was on top of it though and rescued it out of the water within 15 seconds or so. I wasn't too worried though because it is ""waterproof"" right? Just like it says in the description.Webster's gives us this definition of waterproof: impervious to waterespecially : covered or treated with a material (such as a solution of rubber) to prevent permeation by waterJust to be clear, Webster's defines Impervious as :1: not allowing entrance or passage : impenetrablea coat impervious to rainb: not capable of being damaged or harmeda carpet impervious to rough treatment2: not capable of being affected or disturbedimpervious to criticismWell...apparently JBL doesn't agree with those definitions.I immediately dried it off and then stuck it in a bowl of wice....no joy.First the warranty reporting barriers:I had to register the product first. My bad i should have done that, but almost every product I've seen has some kind of serial and model number SOMEWHERE on the product. The serial number is there (it took customer service to show me where...on a small spindle that holds the wrist strap (see picture). No model number anywhere.But, because they required me to register online before I could go through the warranty, I needed a model and serial number, with the model number ONLY being on the OG box. So I just randomly picked one from the drop down and then randomly put a bunch of numbers in for the serial number.Amazingly, this worked...however it said I needed to call their 800 number for warranty info.When I called the recording said they don't do warranty, I have to go through the website...which was what told me to contact them by phone....Anywho..I finally got someone and explained what the situation was. First, she chastised me for allowing it to fall into the water and said that normally that is NOT covered by the warranty.  I, of course, retorted with the definition of waterproof and she said the exterior was waterproof but the interior was not????I was also told that because I bought from Amazon they don't cover the warranty..I have to go through Amazon, which DOES NOT PROCESS WARRANTY CLAIMS.after a bit of raised voices...she agreed to send me a new unit. She then told me how to find the serial number, which is located UNDER the wrist strap in very small letters (see pic)This is getting 2 stars only because, after an hour of f^%ing around..I finally got a warranty replacement.But for FFS... this is outright false advertisement.The tiniest immersion in water is going to brick it.Maybe they should go with ""water resistant"".TL;DR: If you intend to use this around water...don't get one.

I managed to get it on sale for $299, which feels like an incredible bargain for such a feature-rich action camera.#### Build and DesignThe HERO 12 maintains the rugged and durable build quality that GoPro is known for. It’s compact, sturdy, and waterproof up to 33 feet without any additional housing. This makes it perfect for all kinds of adventures, from mountain biking to snorkeling.#### PerformanceThe video quality is outstanding. With the capability to shoot 5.3K video at 60fps, the HERO 12 captures stunningly detailed and smooth footage. The color accuracy and low-light performance are also impressive, making it versatile for various shooting conditions.#### Battery LifeOne of the standout features for me has been the battery life. Even during extended shooting sessions, I experienced no overheating issues, and the battery lasted significantly longer than expected. This reliability is crucial for capturing those perfect moments without interruption.#### User InterfaceThe interface is another highlight. It’s incredibly intuitive and user-friendly, with a responsive touch screen that makes navigating the settings a breeze. The voice control feature is also very handy, allowing me to start and stop recording without physically touching the camera.#### FeaturesThe HERO 12 is packed with advanced features. The HyperSmooth 4.0 stabilization technology is phenomenal, providing gimbal-like stability in the most turbulent conditions. Additionally, the TimeWarp 3.0 feature allows for stunning time-lapse videos, and the live streaming capability is a great bonus for sharing adventures in real-time.#### ConnectivityConnecting the camera to my phone via the GoPro app was seamless. The app provides an array of options for editing and sharing footage, making the whole process very convenient. The built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity ensure easy transfer of files.#### ConclusionOverall, the GoPro HERO 12 is an exceptional action camera that delivers on all fronts. Its combination of superior video quality, excellent battery life, robust build, and user-friendly interface makes it a top choice for both amateur and professional users. At the sale price of $299, it’s an unbeatable value. Highly recommended for anyone looking to capture their adventures in stunning detail!",https://www.amazon.com/GoPro-HERO12-Black-Waterproof-Stabilization/product-reviews/B0CZMG5L6X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1

I recently bought the hero 12 kinda by accident. I wanted to buy one but I didn't want to spend the money though. I had put a camera and a sd card in my cart and forgot about it, well I needed some vacuum bag rolls to freeze something, anyway I bought the go pro with that, oops.I have purchased a few other cameras to mount to my motorcycle, needless to say I was buying the cheapest I could that seemed to be ok. Well they weren't. When I mounted them to my bike the image quality was just terrible. I ride a Harley and I don't know if it was vibrations from that, or the stabilization wasn't up to snuff. I figured because I had the go pro in hand I would at least try it and if it didn't do what I wanted I could send it back.Well it works great. That is all I have to say about it. I haven't even gone into the more advanced set up features; and, I made my first video this morning and I was shocked at how smooth the video capture was. The colors were normal, I mean it looked like it did when I saw it with my own eyes, so I'm good with that. The purpose of the camera is to document if anything happens while I'm riding and it does that very well. I really didn't want to spend that much, but I will be keeping the Hero 12 Black and I am looking forward to learning how to use it better. The 25% off makes it a little easier to swallow buying one. I've looked at them for awhile and the price is reasonable in the end. I have a 256GB micro sd for now but it will take up to a terabyte if I want to spend the money, for long rides.End of the story is basically, I love this camera after one use and look forward to using it more. If I can't get the wife to come with me, I can make her watch the videos of the trip at least. Great camera so far, I'm curious to see how it handles a rain storm but I say buy it! I can't wait to figure out how to bluetooth it to the mic on my helmet for voice commands and to see if I will be able to narrate that way while I am riding. It has so many features that it will take me awhile to learn all of them and get the camera set up to do everything I want, or it is at least capable of.

I decided it was time to upgrade. And...... WOW! What a huge difference! The video quality and stabilization is amazing in comparison. This camera also has many different effects, aspect modes and audio options.Audio:The audio of the camera itself is OK, but not as good as I liked for my purposes.  I like to do some interview style videos.  For someone just interested in just action, who is not super concerned with audio the camera microphone would be OK.  BUT... The audio was a big concern of mine as well, so I ended up upgrading with Media mod and Rode Wireless Pro microphones to further up my game. Highly recommend if you are looking to up your audio game.Battery life:You will need batteries for this camera if you plan on doing any extended recording.  Especially with a media mod.  It really seems to eat up battery charge with the added mod.  Highly recommend having a few  on hand.Heat:The camera is meant to be moving, hence action camera. IT will heat up if setup stationary on a tripod.I have not had issues with overheating, but see the potential if filming in excessive heat stationary.Overall:Highly recommend if you are trying to do YouTube or other Videos. Enjoy! Have Fun!!Originally I tried to go on a budget and just get the camera.

In fact, I was so happy with it that I ordered a second one, apparently that was a bad move. Instead of a ~$150 NVMe drive, I received a ~$50 SATA drive, one with half the amount of storage at that.Obviously, wasn't happy, I was kind of annoyed that I had to return the item to get a refund since it wasn't me who messed up. I don't know why I have to go out of my way to the UPS store to send back an item that cost $100 less than what I ordered but whatever, I guess they have to make sure I'm not trying to scam them out of a pricey SSD drive. I just checked the status of that return today and noticed that my refund still hadn't been processed (I returned the item over a month ago). Luckily a quick chat with an Amazon associate got that finalized, but damn, that was a lot of hoops to jump through to get my money back when I didn't do anything but receive something that I never ordered in place of something I did order.Anyway, just putting this out there because while it's possible that this is a one-time mistake, it could be a pattern if other customers have had similar issues (and if you have, I recommend you write a review so other people know about it). It's just a shame because the actual product itself has been performing great. It's possible that it's doing better than other customer's because mine's under an included MOBO heatsink so I guess keep that in mind.",https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Computing-Workstations-MZ-V9P4T0B-AM/product-reviews/B0CHGT1KFJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1

After restarting, it froze again on the login screen. I initially figured the software I used to clone the drive had skipped or corrupted some files Windows needs to run, so I reformated the drive and cloned the old one again.The second time around, it worked without any freezing for several days, but then it started happening every other day or so. I tried setting it to full power mode in Samsung Magician, doing all sorts of checks to make sure all the files Windows needs were intact, and checking the drive for errors. None of that helped, and I figured it still didn't clone properly, so I planned to use different software to clone the old drive a third time.I then booted from the old drive to copy some new files off this one and clone the drive again, but in the process of copying the files, the drive stopped responding again. Since it wasn't the boot drive this time, it didn't freeze the whole OS, but anything that tried to access files on the drive, read its SMART data, or interact with it in any other way immediately stopped responding. In Task Manager, it was sitting at 100% activity with 0 read and write speeds and occasionally showed average response times over 200,000ms.I restarted again, and that time the drive showed up in Windows but had no capacity, no volumes, and everything acted like it wasn't actually there. After that, it worked long enough to copy my files off and secure erase it to return it.Hopefully I just got a low-probability defect, but it was a major pain to diagnose and unsuccessfully attempt to fix the problems.

Heat has been, is and shall always be the #1 enemy to electronics. Unfortunately, heat dissipation engineering is often underrated, overlooked and badly done, if done at all. With this setup, it never gets above 30c during Samsung Magician performance test. Base mobo temp is 29C.Before attaching the HR09 I removed the sticker form the M.2, the silicone pad from the HR09 and applied Prolimatech PK-3 to the HR09. The picture shows TF-7 but I found that stuff way too thick and didn’t spread well. I used Acetone and q-tips to get the sticker gum off the chip tops. The bottom of the HR09 is steel and really needs to be aluminum but the chips are on top of the M.2 so that is where the most heat can be dissipated. I then attached an NF-A6x25 to the HR09 using some nickel wire. I also needed to augment the foam pad between the M.2 and the mobo. Without doing these mods, it was as if the HR09 wasn't there.My tried and true method of applying heatsink paste that works perfect every single time, no fuss, no worry, and gives visible indication it worked and that the paste isn't old dried out beyond it's shelf life: Every heatsink is always a mm or two wider than the object it is sinking. Simply run tape down the sides a mm or two in from the sides and spread paste on with a single edged razor blade. The narrow thin tape on the edges act like runners for the razor blade to skate on. Hold blade at an angle, it isn't critical, between 10 and 60 degrees doesnt matter. Then peel the tape off. Apparently I didn't take a picture of the HR09 when I did that so I am including a picture of the CPU heatsink done in the exact same manner to give you the idea. They really should include some narrow, thin cellophane tape and a single sided razor blade instead of a uselss spatula.Great drive for a reasonable price.

I did not install the 32GB memory card because I only wanted it for viewing, not storing photos or videos.User manual says “viewing distance in all dark: 200M-300M”.  I used it to see out my back window in total darkness, with no house lights on.  I could see gray tree trunks and gray leaves on bushes up to 36’ (=11M), and barely discernable gray tree trunks a few meters beyond that, but everything else was just a gray screen.  I turned the focus wheel a lot in both directions, with no improvement.  When observing through a window, the bright screen light causes a reflection off the window, so I was actually viewing things in the room (lamp, etc) instead of outside.  I thought the solution was to view through the screened portion of my window, not the glass.  But after working with it for several nights, I decided it was just a horrible product….until one final try.  I noticed when viewing close-up that there was a very faint grid over the image, which was actually my window screen.  I removed the mesh screen from my window and OH MY GOSH….THE WOODS LIT UP IN THE DARK!  It was transformational.  There is nothing in the instruction manual or in the product description that says don’t use it for viewing through a glass window, or window screen.SOME DRAWBACKS:Black writing on black buttons on a black case.  It’s very hard to read the writing, but you also can’t feel or identify the buttons in the dark.  The power and menu buttons are level with the case, and the four outside buttons are raised just slightly above the case.The viewing screen is very bright and lights up my face.  This would not be good if you don’t want to be easily seen while using it at night.  There is a “screen brightness” setting under the Menu button, but the user manual doesn’t tell you how to adjust Menu settings at all.  Mine was defaulted to level 5.  After playing around with the buttons while on the Menu screen, I found that the “Shot” button displays the 7 levels, then use the up/down IR buttons to change the level, then press Shot button again to retain the setting.  But regardless of the setting, the screen will still light up my face.  The “Night Vision Sensitivity” in the Menu screen was defaulted to “mild”, so I changed it to “high” with the same Shot/IR/Shot buttons.I installed 6 AA batteries and saw the 7 IR levels on the screen the first time I used it, but the next time it would not rise above IR level 4 without automatically shutting off.  User manual says “when the battery power is low, the IR levels will down automatically”.  I bought new AA batteries and was now able to raise the IR level to 7 (max) with each use.  This product should be equipped with a rechargeable battery instead, because the bright viewing screen will drain batteries quickly.During daylight, without using IR, the quality is really bad.  The view is mostly gray, not much color, and very grainy.  Can definitely see much better with the naked eye.I tried the “New and Special Color Effects” listed in the manual, which changes everything you are viewing to either Luminous Green or Purple.

While the overall Bluetooth performance has better sound than the best of their phones, performance is frustrating! The audio gaps occasionally on devices using Qualcomm APT-X Bluetooth and fails completely when LDAP is demanded from the driver. I now understand why a wired headphone jack is provided...there aren't enough resources to do Bluetooth satisfactorily. My A9+ has Android 14 but it appears this tablet barely has enough resources to run it. Also, compared to my previous Galaxy Tab S6, maximum SD card size is limited to 1GB instead of 2GB. I put all my data on the SD card and only use the internal for apps and the operating system. This assures my data cannot be monitored by Google & Samsung. Also, it's alot bigger than the 128GB internal storage which I use for the operating system and apps. These are the main bones of contention with the Galaxy Tab A9+While there is no fingerprint login on this tablet, the face tracking works remarkably well! Even in relatively low light, the tablet opens right up. If you are backlit however, the face tracking doesn't work...that's pretty much to be expected. For a screen that is not OLED, the image quality is quite good. Both cameras work nicely for videoconferencing and it takes reasonably good photos and video, something my Galaxy Tab S6 did not do well at all! Plays even 4K video I've shot with my Note 20 Ultra and Canon M50 nicely. Photos are reproduced very accurately.In conclusion I can say the following: Some of us don't play video games, in fact I could care less for that. A tablet should have strong suits not only in video performance but audio as well. This A9+ seems to fall flat on it's face in this area and I am somewhat disappointed by this!

The video camera was very poor. The resolution is lower and the pictures are washed out. It does not even have auto focus. I guess that I have been spoiled with the S series for phones and tablets. This is nowhere close to the quality of picture as my Tab S8+ or my S23 ultra. I am returning it to order the Tab S9+. If the picture and camera quality are not of importance to you, the Tab A9+ will probably be fine for you. I did like that it had 4 speakers which assists if you want to use the tablet in vertical rather than horizontal. Other that resolution and camera, it seems to be a quality device.

I was looking for something really basic that I could read at camp, check maps, and listen to music offline while hiking. Being a Samsung, it meant I would be able to find a decent case for it to provide at least some basic protection. If it got damaged during the hike, well... it was a cheap tablet so it should be good enough.It had 55% battery when it arrived, so I plugged it into a USB-C cable I had plugged into the USB port on my wall outlet. I figured this would be alright since it would need to be charged from a portable power source in the field anyway. After 48 minutes, it managed to charge only to 64%! I wanted to err on it being my cable, so I plugged it into a USB-C power brick instead and put that in my outlet. My wall outlets are 20w, and this requires 15w to charge, so it should totally work.It managed to hit 100% 4.5 hours later. Taking four and a half hours to charge anything 36% is insane. When I finally was able to power the tablet on, the screen was so dim, I could barely see anything. After rushing through the typical Android setup, I managed to increase the display brightness to around 50%. After installing 3 apps, I noticed that the battery was at 93% for less than a half hour of use.I definitely do not recommend this tablet.

From the moment I unboxed it, I was impressed by its sleek design and the quality of its build.

The screen resolution is stunning, providing crisp and clear visuals that make watching videos, browsing the web, and reading e-books a pleasure.One of the standout features of this tablet is its quad speakers. The sound quality is phenomenal, with rich, deep bass and clear highs that make listening to music and watching movies an immersive experience. Whether I’m using it for entertainment or for video calls, the audio performance is top-notch. The speakers are strategically placed to ensure that the sound is evenly distributed, no matter how I hold the tablet.The performance of the SAMSUNG Galaxy Tab A9+ is equally impressive.

The tablet also supports a variety of accessories, such as keyboards and styluses, which enhance its functionality even further.In terms of connectivity, the SAMSUNG Galaxy Tab A9+ has everything I need. It connects seamlessly to Wi-Fi and Bluetooth devices, and the signal strength is consistently strong. The tablet also has a USB-C port for fast charging and data transfer, which is incredibly convenient.

I was wondering how well this tablet could serve as a laptop replacement, but I needn't have worried. It does everything my old laptop does, and it does it much faster and much more efficiently. Needless to say, I am very pleased with this device.The things I like best about my Galaxy Tab A9+ tablet:1. The 11-inch screen is large enough for me to see clearly with my aging eyes. Colors are vivid, and the text is crisp and clear. I can make the text bigger whenever I need to.2. The sound is great! The tablet featores four speakers (two on eack end) that pump clean, crisp audio into my room.3. Processor speed is very fast. Apps open in just a few seconds (or less), and there is almost no lag between my screen tap and program execution.4.  My tablet came with 128gb of storage and 8gb of RAM. I have had no issues with storage space or with slowed-down multitasking. I've had as many as 20 apps open in the background at the same time, with no noticeable lag.5. My tablet came with Android 13 and UI 6.0 unstalled, but both programs automatically updated to Android 14 and UI 6.1 within a month. These latest versions of these programs are outstanding.6.  I bought my tablet with two key essential accessories: a Bluetooth keyboard and a heavy-duty tablet case/stand combination. (I am typing this review on the Bluetooth keyboard right now.) These accessories integrate perfectly with my Samsung Galaxy Tab A9+ and help immeasurably in, making it an outstanding laptop replacement.I'm sure I could think of many more features I like, but you get the idea.

But I'd give it 4 and 1/2 stars if I could. I hate the keyboard. When you want to use emojis, hand gestures, animals and all that -- it's divided up into separate sections instead of one page. So when you want to access say a hand gesture instead of a face, you have to press a button at the top of the keyboard to get to it. And if there isn't a symbol for what you want at top of the keyboard, you have to hit the search to find it. I find this very inconvenient. After all the fuss I've heard about Samsung Galaxy, I can't believe how small and clumsy this keyboard is. Charging takes awhile, so I'm using a block -- plugging it into the wall seems to improve the speed of the recharge. The charger cable that comes with it is very short and flimsy -- so I'm using a sturdier cable I bought for it. Setup for this tab was the worst I've ever experienced. I was ordered to get an app in my Playstore called SmartSwitch in order to set it up. Google Setup has always worked fine for me with every other tab I've purchased, but I wasn't allowed to use it with this one. It had to be SMART SWITCH or not at all, which required me to plunk out $7.50 with my credit card! And the setup was no better than Google and took a few hours besides. I paid extra and bought the 8gb version of this tablet because I'm a serious gamer and I must have speed. I used it constantly this past weekend during my online team tournament and it worked very smoothly with long lasting battery life. It's been interesting to check out a Samsung Galaxy at last and it is a beautiful tablet well worth having.",https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Android-Speakers-Upgraded-Graphite/product-reviews/B0CLF3VPMV/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1

It comes with a lot of bloatware, easily removed, and I was able to easily pair my phone settings to the tablet wirelessly - no problem. Haven't tried using the tablet as a phone yet but I probably will in the future just because it would be handy bedside. So far I have enjoyed it, but I am disappointed that Samsung has sooooo many updates that consume a lot of time. I knew there would be a lot of updates when I first turned it on, but several days in I can still expect a Samsung update almost on a daily basis, and this is after I've done all the customizing that I want. Drives me nuts, so I encourage any new user to take advantage of being able to NOT do auto updates or you'll be without use of the tablet which can be very exasperating and circumvents the desire to quickly search for something!  Do them on command or schedule them!  Samsung - get with it and bundle updates so they are less frequent, albeit more time consuming for each one. Other than that, apps load quickly and the display is crisp and clear and the sound is very good as are response times when moving from app to app or screen to screen. The battery life has been very good so far, and seems better than my cell phone. One thing I don't understand is why Samsung has offset the search bar on the home screen.....it is off center to the left on the screen no matter how I turn the device. Not a deal breaker but just looks very odd, if not outright silly on an otherwise very classy looking screen. The tablet is quite light, very thin, and the 10"" size is great for people who may be visually impaired like me. I especially like the touch keyboard that automatically displays with the Google search bar.

Two weeks ago I would have given more stars, a week ago the screen started flashing intermittently, then all photos and videos got very dark and hard to see. Now it's got massive burn in problems.  The app doesn't even have to be on screen very long before you can see a shadow image in the background.  After a search I found this is a very common issue with no fix. I could deal with the shadow image but being able to see images is important to me and how I use my tablets so I am looking for a different brand. I've had Samsung tablets before with no issue. Very annoying.  Edit: I hadn't been going to try to return or repair as I thought it might have been too long.

However, this renewed phone had a non-Apple replacement screen that was noticeably low in quality - grainy, with colors dulled, and it cut off part of the display area. Touch responsiveness was bad. Given Amazon pledge that the product was ""professionally inspected and tested by Amazon-qualified supplier,"" I feel the substandard screen should have been spotted and the lower quality disclosed. My family member and my time were wasted by this attempt to pass off a lower quality solution.

So, that has always made me a little bit gunshy regarding that particular situation.With that said, as a full-time caregiver for the last 11 years, I have not been able to work and unfortunately can no longer purchase the best of the best with the flagship phones that I used to get back in the day. Many of my parents doctors do some video visits and some of them actually prefer FaceTime so as a result, having an iPhone was actually partly a necessity for that reason.I have always been an Android girl, )still have that too), so I didn’t quite know what iPhone I needed to get, but after some research, I finally settled on what I thought would be the best choice for me both with regard to the technology inside and with the price as well as the warranty.I had actually considered either an iPhone 11 or an iPhone 13 as my choice. As we are now on the 15 I found the 13 to be the wisest choice of the two.After researching many different sites, some very reputable and actually recommended by people, I decided to land on Amazon‘s renewed program because I’ve always had a nice experience when there have been any issues with a product and I’ve never had any problems with customer service. They’ve always been very helpful and I thought if anything were to happen with the phone, I would be hoping to have the same type of experience.In looking at the options, I chose to actually pay more to have one that was put forth by Amazon themselves because they offered a year warranty as opposed to many of the others who were a bit cheaper and offered maybe 30 days or so etc.And hey, so far, so good! The Phone arrived. It was in perfect cosmetic condition and I have not had any issues with it since. The battery was at 87% and although I would’ve liked to had it higher than that, I was glad to see that it still was pretty snappy when I needed it to be.So I would say that I have been very pleased so far and I would absolutely recommend the renewed program to anyone interested, but can only speak to the actual product provided by Amazon itself, however, I’m sure many of the third-party individuals that sell refurbished items may have some really good product themselves.Ah…there I go again…refurbished…renewed…to-may-toe…to-mah-toe… well you get the jist…",https://www.amazon.com/Apple-iPhone-13-128GB-Midnight/product-reviews/B09LNW3CY2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1

It’s a little taller than my 15oz coffee mug, same height as small box of Kleenex. The app is super easy to use. Printing is fairly quick. Print quality is fairly decent. It prints text pretty easily, but if you upload a custom logo or image, it’s a little distorted. The description states the labels are water and oil proof, but the ones that I have in cupboard beneath my sink and the ones on my stainless steel table have started to fade after getting wet. This is with the labels that come already with the printer. I’d understand having this issue if I were to be using cheaper labels from some other place, but to be advertising their own labels as water and oil proof is a little misleading.I’ve enjoyed adding labels to things around the house since it’s so quick and easy to use. Its small size fits nicely in kitchen drawer or desk drawers. It has a built in wrist strap which you could use to hang it if you wanted to. I got the case for mine since it’ll reside in the kitchen and the case will help keep it clean. Having eight people living in our house is nice to add labels to things to lessen the frequent question of “where’s ______ item” after I’ve rearranged things.I’d give this printer 5 stars, but had to deduct one star for the labels that come with being not water proof as stated in the description. Also, it took me a bit to figure out how to turn it off. The instructions that came with it only say how to turn it on and pair it with the app. I thought maybe it would turn itself off after you close the app and disconnect from the printer.  It would be nice if the instruction book stated “To turn off, press and hold the indicator button,” or if it would auto power off after you close the app.  For the price, this is an excellent little label maker printer. Another thing I find slightly annoying is having to have the printer connected to your phone to create labels. It would be nice if you could create your labels in the app, save them in the app, then turn on the printer to print.Overall this is a very excellent, low cost thermal label printer.",https://www.amazon.com/Nelko-P21-Bluetooth-Templates-Organizing/product-reviews/B0C3L93F2Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1

However, the ability of this label maker to wirelessly connect to my devices via Bluetooth is what really sets it apart from other similar products on the market The entire labeling process is simplified as a result of this function of removing the prerequisite use of cables and cables. Simple instructions and simple user interfaces get me through the process without any problems. I just connected and looked at all the templates available, each designed for different labeling. The simple power of the label manufacturer was on full display when it was used to create barcodes and organize archives. A pleasant and welcome surprise was the availability of a mobile app that allowed for individual characters. I had the ability to customize the characters by choosing fonts, colors, and even logos. My planning efforts got a creative boost thanks to this tweak, making the characters not only useful but also aesthetically pleasing. The excellent typography was the thing that impressed me the most. The density and clarity of the text as well as the graphics are far better than I expected. My attempts to organize everything were successful as the adhesive didn't get on any of the materials used, be it paper files or plastic containers I love to see my office space now organized large, uncluttered, and aesthetically pleasing.

I think a larger size vertically would be better, so that you could do a bigger font without having to keep it within such a small perimeter.3) along with size, the label roll that came with it are individual little rectangles all the same size - which can be helpful but I’ve used other ones (back in the day) that were just 1 big roll of sticker and you could type something longer and it would just go as long as you’d want.

The thing is, the printer is returned and refunded back to Amazon and using a different model. So now I have the toner for a printer I no longer have. Good job HP!----------------------4th Update 5/8/24:Since it has been a week since the last time HP Support called me, I decided to call them. After about 20 minutes, I was again told that my case was escalated (two weeks ago) and they still can't order replacement toner to replace the toner cartridges that aren't working right on this (new) printer MPF3301fdw. They said I should get a call back on Friday.If I don't hear from them or they can't send new toners, then I am sending this model back.I then may go with the 283fdw model, since it is identical to my 281 model that went bad after 4.5 years of use (belt went bad).All I can say is HP Support is pretty much useless.If you are looking for a color laser printer, you're better off going with the 283fdw model that is supported and has toner available for purchase.The newest 3301fdw has no support from HP since it is so new, and none of the toners are in-stock because it is a new model. Also, it prints color pictures MUCH darker than the 281 and 283 model. To me, the 281/283 prints more natural and realistic color pictures than the 3301.----------------------3rd Update 5/2/24:I have got 2 call-backs from HP Support this week Monday and Tuesday saying they are still not able to put in an order for the defect replacement toner (see full review below). They say the issue is that since this printer model MFP 3301fdw is so new that it isn't in their system for support, and that the 218A toners are not in stock to send out for replacement.As far as I'm concerned, this is a total failure on HP. You have a new printer with printing defects. Not sure if it's the actual printer or the toners that are bad. They can't send out replacement toner because none is available.At this point, I'm just going to return this back to Amazon. My HP M281fdw never had any issues until just last month, which is why I ordered this one. So I might get the M283 model, since it's basically identical to my M281 model and at least there is toner in stock for it.-----------------2nd Update 4/29/24:Since HP Support is basically useless and isn't able to replace the defective toners, which has streaks/banding and areas where no color is transfered to the HP Paper. I decided to buy another HP 3301fdw printer that comes with new toners and see how it prints. It was delivered yesterday and I printed about 25 pictures on it, and so far the quality has been better, no banding issue and all the colors are being transfered/fused to the paper. But after about 25 color picture and 15 black text pages, the ""introductory toner cartridges"" are down to 20% capacity! How is this possible? It Specs PDF says the introduction toners are good for a few hundred pages. I've only done 25 pictures + 15 text pages (under 50 pages total) and it's down to 20% capacity? Unless the Calibration On Start Up is using a lot of toner, so I turned that Off.I'm still not sure about this printer, as no one (including Amazon or HP) have the 218A standard capacity toner or the 218X high capacity toner in-stock. So how do you get toner for it???-------------------1st Update: 4/27/24:This is an update to my original review.I would also like to point out all the 5 star reviews for this MFP 3301fdw  printer are from Amazon Vine, which means the person got the printer for free at no cost and only had to agree to write an review. I actually paid full price for this printer, so I am reviewing it as a paying customer. Over the 8 days that I have had the HP MFP 3301fdw printer, the color prints have had issues with the toner not fusong to the HP Paper. I called HP Support on 4/24/24 and was on the phone with them (India) for almost an hour and they had to do a video call to show them the printer and the pictures with the color issue. The woman said he was going to replace the toner, since she believed that was the problem and was down to 20%. But she wasn't able to get the toner ordered, and said it would be taken care of through their back end department. Then several hours later I got an HP saying the case was closed. I called the following day on Thursday and spoke to someone else. They also said they couldn't get replacement toner ordered and said they would bring it to their internal support and asked if they could call me the next day Friday at 1pm. So then on Friday I'm waiting for them to call at 1pm and nothing. I end up calling at 1:45pm. The first person I talk to says they are not trained on this printer, and I have to talk to ""industrial printer support"". They transfer me, and the person there says this is not a industrial printer (big surprise) and has to transfer me back to home office printers. Finally after 30 min I was able to talk to someone. They also said they couldn't order the toner, and said they have to call back next week on Tuesday.This is absolutely the worst support (well no support) I've ever had from a company. If a large company like HP can't make the toners right, causing print issues, and then can't put in an order for replacement toner and takes multiple phone calls, there is basically no support for HP! I have no trust in this printer or in HP to stand by it for the 1 year manufacturers warranty.I did look to see if the toner was available for order (either the standard capacity or high capacity) and no one (including HP and Amazon) has the toners in stock, and shows it won't be available for 1-2 months. How can you sell a printer and not even have the toner in stock when the limited ""introductory toner"" runs out after about 150 prints?At this point, I would either need to replace my old old HP M281fdw printer with the 283 model, which is basically the same unit and features (just a different toner ) or go with a different brand.-------------------Original Review:First off, I have been using the HP 281 color laser since 2019 without any problems, until a month ago there was issues and the printer started to die and go out. I decided to replace it with with 3301 model, since it is the newest version. I got it last week and after setting up the printer it begins by initializing the pre installed toners and then a calibration. I went into the menu and did a Print Quality Test that shows the toner colors on a page, and there was major streaks in the colors (,mostly cyan blue and magenta). I ran it 10 times and did a few more Calibrations and it got a little better but was still there.I then tried printing some high quality pictures that I had and noticed that there was areas where the toner (,color) was not sticking on the paper (HP Premiums 24). Areas of the picture that was blue sky, you could see parts that was missing toner, showing the white paper behind it. Or if it was a picture that had some dark/black areas, again you could see areas where the black was not transferring and could see the white paper.I called HP Support yesterday about this, as my old 281 printer never had this problem. Support has to do a video call to see the printed issues on the papers. After I showed them, they said they wanted to replace the toner to see if new toner would fix the problem. But after 40 minutes, they could not get the system to have a replacement toner order put in. She said it would be sent to their back-end department and I would get an email about the toner being sent. A few hours later I got an email saying my case my closed. I called back today at 8am when they open and the guy that I talked to needed a ton of information again. But he also said he could not get the system to take an order for replacement toner, and would have to talk to their internal support and he would call me tomorrow with an update.This is totally unexceptionable.My 281 printer was $350 and worked fine for 4.5 years. This new 3301 printer has issues (possible the toner defect?) being brand new, and still can't get the toners replaced after 2 calls. At this point if they can't get the toner replaced.....or if I do get a replacement and it still has the same problem, then I'll have to either replace the 3301 with another 3301 to see if mine was defective, or go with a different brand like Canon.As far as the 3301 printer, I do like the larger LCD display, and it is faster and quieter than my 281 model. Black text looks the same on both. When doing color photos, the 3301 does looks to have more realistic color than the 281, but it is marred by the areas of the print where the toner is not transferring to the paper making white see-though areas.I will update this review based on what happens with HP support, getting the toner replaced or not.",https://www.amazon.com/HP-Laserjet-3301fdw-Wireless-499Q5F/product-reviews/B0CTW43KHQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1

For one thing the toner life, if actually printing in color frequently, is dismal. And for another, the driver immediately and automatically defaults (I understand that ""automatically"" and ""defaults"" may look redundant) to 2-side printing. But when I use both terms I mean that there is absolutely no way to make it default to 1-sided pages. Not with the HP driver that is available from HP or from HP via Microsoft. So one has to be eternally vigilant about checking a different box with every print batch or you will waste paper and toner on anywhere from 1 to 250 pages (which is the size of the tray) if you're not watching the thing work as it prints. But that's where the pathetic toner life comes into play. It wasted about 50 pages of 2-sided printing for me before I noticed that I had to make sure to change it every time. That means that, apparently, the toner cartridges were almost halfway depleted after a mistaken 50 page print task which wasn't supposed to be 2-sided. And the HP cartridges are not cheap. Which brings me back to the headline that this is simply not a good small business printer, let alone a great value.As far as print quality, it's fine. About what's to be expected in 2024 for this type of machine. But with the volume limitations, the constant vigilance needed for every task, and the seemingly intentional low life expectancy of the toner cartridges, it's simply not a good value at all, unless you're getting it for scanning. But good scanners can be had for a fraction of this price.So that I don't lead any readers of this review astray, here are the parameters of the job(s) that completely frustrated me. You be the judge on whether this will meet your ""business"" needs.300-400 pages of 8.5x11"" pages with about 75% needing some color and around 45% needing color on most of the page (NOT photos or graphics) in a day (knowing that would mean new cartridges after the job) and it still disappointed. I was getting warnings and then urgent warnings on toner life about 2/3 of the way in.Lack of a manual feed tray for printing envelopes or thick paper or labels. It does OK with putting that kind of media in the main tray, but it did jam a few times on typical Avery tab labels which are not much thicker, if at all, than standard 24lb laser printer paper.The built-in interface w/ touch screen is not good. There are not many options for improving or calibrating - to which I'll add a disclaimer that even those ""workgroup"" printers commonly available from Brother, HP or Canon don't seem to make much of a visible difference with adjustments even though they have more granular menus - to do much about the differences between how colors, hues, and darkness/brightness/saturation/contrast actually shows up on the printed page.I'm sure this printer would be fine for a mom-n-pop travel agency that still needs printed media strictly relegated to 8.5x11 or slightly smaller/larger media/paper with only a few ""major"" print jobs a week. But I really find myself scratching my head when I read PC Magazine, CNET, and the like praising these small printers as ""business"" ready (again, even though MOST of us RARELY need to print stuff) when in fact they fall WELL short of ""workgroup"" printers like....I dunno....the Brother 83XXX family from a few years ago that comes with a default main tray capable of holding at least 500 sheets of letter and with multiple options (including aftermarket) for toner cartridge capacity. The only thing those lack is a scanner, but as noted, good scanners are cheap now. And who needs dedicated copiers? Not someone buying one of the products in this class.NOT recommended. Especially not at the $500+ price point.",https://www.amazon.com/HP-Laserjet-3301fdw-Wireless-499Q5F/product-reviews/B0CTW43KHQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1

It's my work printer, and it lives in a fairly dirty environment, even though I do my best to keep it clean. I had already decided when the Epson died to give laser a try to see if it lasted any longer than the inkjets I've had in the past. With Prime shipping, I could get this HP here in one day, with the time crunch I was under it seemed like the best route to go, even though I was wary about the HP brand. I should have just explained to the people who were waiting on me that I was having technical difficulties and got something that shipped slower.My issues are: first and foremost, the software. I was prepared for it to be bad, but if I knew just how bad it was I wouldn't have bought the printer. Of course, HP wants you install their full software suite. I don't want that, I just want the drivers. After hunting around for awhile, I finally found the drivers without the software package. Got those all downloaded and installed, and while my PC would recognize the printer, it wouldn't pick up the scanner. After trying several things unsuccessfully, I decided it was only going to pick up the scanner if I downloaded the full software suite. So I did. This is where my biggest caution comes in. (All caps so you take me seriously here) IF YOU ARE PLANNING ON SCANNING AND DON'T WANT TO SPEND THE TIME TO FIND WORK AROUNDS, DON'T BUY THIS PRINTER. The HP software suite only allows you to scan into their cloud service, not directly to your PC. 100% deal breaker. I already have cloud services that I pay for. I don't need HP's on top of it. I want my scans to go onto my PC, not into any of the cloud services, even the ones I pay for. I sometimes scan sensitive business information, and it's bad enough just saving it on my PC, I sure as hell don't want it on HP's cloud service. At this point I was ready to send the printer back and start over. But, after some more digging, I found another work around by downloading HP's old scanner software called simply HP Scan (alternatively, you can use Window's native scan software, but you don't get as many options).So after about two days of trying to get it to work, I finally was able to resume my large printing job. The box the printer came in said I should get about 1350 pages out of the toner cartridges it came with. That was plenty for me to finish, so I didn't order any more. I printed 130 pages and started to get notifications that I was running low on toner. At first I thought it was a mistake. So I took all the cartridges out, shook them around, and plugged them back in. Nope, not a mistake. I understood that I was printing full color pages, satellite maps to be exact, and I expected that I wouldn't get the full 1350 pages the box promised. But 130? 1200 pages LESS than what the box said? Come on. So I start looking for toner. None to be found. Everywhere is out of stock of yellow, the first color to run low. Ok. I get it. It's COVID times, stock is weird, getting parts and supplies is hard. Trust me, you're preaching to the choir here. So I won't hold it against HP, but I did want to cry at this point. I just threw in the towel and finished the project in greyscale. Whatever. I ordered some toner from our normal ink supplier, which still hasn't shown up. Hopefully I get it soon.What happened today is what prompted me to write this review. I will be totally upfront here, this is probably part of my poor research before I bought this printer. But, it doesn't have auto duplex scanning/copying. Unless I'm missing it somewhere. But, you have to scan all of front pages first, walk over to the printer, flip the stack and scan all of the back pages second. If you're just trying to copy, there is no option for 2 sided to 2 sided. Like. Come on. It's 2021. My 5 year old Epson that I paid $100 for could do that. This is a $500 printer aimed towards small businesses, and yet it can't do something as simple as auto duplex scan/copy. It can auto duplex print, so why can't it when I'm scanning/copying?Print quality is fine, connecting to wifi was simple, it prints fairly quickly. It's loud and bulky, but in my business office, I can deal with those downsides. At home, it would be more of an issue I think. But, all things considered, I really wish I would have listened to my gut and stayed away from HP. If one more thing irritates me about this printer, it's going up for sale on Marketplace, and I'm getting something different. It may go up for sale on Marketplace anyway.",https://www.amazon.com/HP-Laserjet-3301fdw-Wireless-499Q5F/product-reviews/B0CTW43KHQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1

It prints fast - haven't really needed to scan much yet, and really FAX?  It's 2021 ... stop pretending that it's 1990!  So nope, will NEVER use that.  The unit can print on both sides (requirement for me) and holds quite a lot of paper in the tray.Now to the odd things - perhaps the not so ""positive"".  The printer wants/requires internet access. Even if you just need an office printer, if it cannot see the internet it gets mad at you and stops working.  Our network is restricted - access to the internet is monitored and limited. What seems to happen is after X number of failures to talk to some hp server, the printer claims the wifi is broken and stops working. It's happened several times now - it will claim it's working but ""no connectivity"" and somehow you cannot tell the printer to just retry the wifi again.  Turning it off and then on again seems to be the only option.Since we're not using ""e-printing"" or whatever HP calls it - nobody needs to print when they aren't in the office. That's what VPN is for.  This unit needs to simply serve the clients on the network it's attached to. It should simply wait for an incoming connection - but no, it wants an active role for some reason. Something it's being denied and it seems to fail every week or so.  And of course nobody notices until they need to print something and ""it won't work"".Technically the printer supports quite a few protocols and ways to connect. That's great - and one of the reason I choose the model. From wired, to wireless and USB - the choice is yours. It even support special apple wireless and direct wifi - stuff I turned off, so there aren't more SSIDs in the wild for people to hack in on.  If you do not use static IP addresses, the unit will use mDNS to allow clients to find it.  Without mDNS your clients will have to manually be told about the printer - which shouldn't be a problem. A simple print-server will do just fine, and you can turn off all the broadcast traffic and get better audit/control with what/who is printing.  Bottom line, you have a lot of options and that's important. Over time your need may change, and it's good to know that the unit supports a wide range of options.Our clients are Linux based or Chromebooks, phones etc.  HP claims you must use the app to configure the printer, but that's not my experience. As a matter of fact, the ""HP Smart"" app seems to do very little to help with the printer that any computer cannot tell me. It seems to be a platform to allow HP to present you with ads and ""suggestions"" of what to buy - their toner, their paper etc. - so far any Linux workstation is a simple ""cups add printer"" - in the ""control panel"" you simple add a printer, and it finds it on the network and the rest is ...well, that's it. It's done.  For scanning, you could manually add the IP to the sane setup, but so far I haven't needed to - it finds the printer/scanner automatically using mDNS.Configuring the printer can easily be done through it's web-interface.  If you name the printer, you can provide the printer a TLS certificate and get some validation that it's a trusted device on your network.The printer seems designed for small offices, it has all the network features I would expect - but it comes with a lot of 'add stuff"" which is the only way I can explain why it wants to access the internet on a regular basis.",https://www.amazon.com/HP-Laserjet-3301fdw-Wireless-499Q5F/product-reviews/B0CTW43KHQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1

Wanted to upgrade to machines with a scanner feed, so went this direction based on reviews. Now, I'm not a network engineer, and not an IT pro, but I've had no problems setting up both work and home networks and maintained them for years. At the shop I typically have 15 devices on, and at home between 30-40 depending on day and time.  All devices happy, chatting with each other and the outside world, everything just works.Then comes the printer switch, and my whole world comes crashing down. This has been the most maddening, awful experience, with both printers, that I have had with a network device since WiFi was in its infancy.  I truly want to go full Office Space on both of them. Today's incident sealed it. Wife home doing school finals. I'm at my shop. After 2 solid weeks of no problems, no drop-offs, no changes in our infrastructure at all, can't print or scan. Scanning is a must because she has to show work.  I get home and despite seeing the printer on our local network using the Eero app, and seeing wife's PC on the same network, both connected to the same Eero, neither can see each other. I literally typed the IP address into the URL field, nope, doesn't exist. Fine, let me find one of those weird printer-only USB cables just to get her out of the woods. Connected printer to Carbon X1, scan app sees the printer, scan commences, then errors out at the end.Thousand bucks down the drain for 2 of these garbage paperweights.  Now dreading getting on the phone with tech support only to likely hear ""did you plug it in until it clicks?""Update: updated my Eero setup to include WPA3 authentication, and it worked!  For 4 whole days.  Tried to print this morning, ""printer offline"".  Printer confirmed to be on. Checked all devices on the network. Both of our laptops, and this pile of garbage ""printer"" showing on the network, and both even connected to the same Eero. I type in the IP address into a browser, and the printer page comes up with all of the settings.  But, can I print?  Nope.  Full Eero network reboot, unplug printer, plug it back in, and we can print again...from only one of our laptops.  I normally have to reboot the network *maybe* 2x/year.  I'll keep adding to this as needed.Again, DO NOT BUY THIS PILE OF JUNK.6/4/21 - good news, we made it almost 7 days without having to reboot our whole world!  But today, customers lined up, ready to cash out, can't print. Can't scan.  Nothing changed in our infrastructure.  Ten minutes rebooting our world, and everything works again. Seriously, this is probably the worst piece of tech on the market right now.7/7/21 - just got the alert that my printer is low on all toner.  I bought this printer on 4/15 for $488.  It is now 7/7, and just added 4 genuine HP toner cartridges to my cart here.  Total will be $432.  This is the type of thing that inspires movies like Falling Down.  Oh, and if I click on the handy window that shows up every damn time I print that says ""ORDER SUPPLIES!"", it takes me to the HP store, where all but black toner is sold out.  So soon, I'll be writing again about a printer that I won't be able to use at all.  Awesome.11/13/21 - Yet another reminder of why HP might be the worst company on the face of the earth.  Remember when I had to spend $432 on toner 4 months ago?  So, like Kramer and the used car salesman trying to see how far they could get on the low fuel light, I kept dismissing the ""Critically low"" messages every time we'd print at my shop.  We print roughly 15-20 pages per day.  Yeah, I have yet to replace the toner, and the pages still look fine.1/12/22 - still printing just fine. Toner message screaming at me every time I print.3/30/22 - ditto the last update.8/15/24 - still falls off network (both at home and at my shop), still need to reinstall software, still the worst piles of crap in the printer universe.",https://www.amazon.com/HP-Laserjet-3301fdw-Wireless-499Q5F/product-reviews/B0CTW43KHQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1

I deleted it and then downloaded the printer driver itself along with the scanner app, so no more nag ads and a big privacy boost.Print quality is good, but printing a bunch of envelopes from tray 2 is slow and requires you to set up the paper type and size to the envelope used. Originally I had set tray 1 (the slot feed) for envelopes but got tired of standing there feeding it envelopes one-by-one.The scanner app is OK, but not very straightforward compared to the one I used for my Officejet AIO.Still on the small HP starter toner carts that came pre-installed, so I don't know if the offbrand ones I bought, which use HP firmware, actually work. They are less than half HP's price for a similar toner capacity. Seems HP makes their profit on the supplies, which is why they monitor for genuine HP brand.EDIT: After using it for several months now, I agree with the other reviewers that the wifi connectivity is a problem. My Win 11 computer is not able to find the printer (""offline"") even when the Eero mesh wifi app says the printer is online. I had to dig out the old USB cable and use it instead. Luckily I only print from the computer, but my son and others use the wifi connection.Also, after resetting the paper type and size between #10 envelopes and letter-sized paper, now the printer wants me to press the ""OK to print"" button on the screen. Doesn't it recognize the correct paper size in tray #2 anymore?Downgraded it to 3 stars.",https://www.amazon.com/HP-Laserjet-3301fdw-Wireless-499Q5F/product-reviews/B0CTW43KHQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1

I am using the HP software to install the printer and scanner, and all I have running is normal Windows Defender (no third party firewall applications or anything).  The software says a firewall is blocking the printer, but, there are no firewalls.  Super frustrating when a company releases a product that has tons of software issues and just never chooses to correct them.  When it does print, it does a great job.

Print quality is excellent and scanning and copying features work fine.  I love the way it prints #10 envelopes.  But the geniuses who designed the embedded software should be fired.When the printer starts up, it whines and groans and bangs for the better part of a minute.  Others have pointed out how noisy it is and how horrible the instructions are.  They are correct.  But, the most weird thing is it starts when you turn on a warm light in the room.  My printer is connected to my home network via Wi-Fi.  Sending a print job from another room does not wake it up. AirPrint is not available when it is sleeping.  Only turning on a light, or manually starting the printer, wakes it up.  You cannot turn  off going to sleep.I can’t find this documented anywhere.  My home office has a ceiling light with LEDs and a desk lamp with a CFL.  When I turn on the desk lamp, the printer starts up, but not when I turn on the ceiling light!Who thought this up???  HP thinks every time I turn on the light, I want to print something?  They think no one wants to print when they are not in the room with the printer?  You can’t get much dumber than that, HP.  The 10-year-old Brother inkjet I replaced made AirPrint available 24-7 and woke up whenever I sent it a print job.  That’s 10-year-old technology!Incidentally, apparently only turning a motor keeps it awake, not sending it an empty print job nor downloading from its HTML server.

Most recently, my laptop can see the printer, but can't communicate, and always reports that the printer is offline. I have wasted hours this week trying to get it working again and I am done. I can't recommend this printer. I may not be an IT Specialist, but I'm also not dumb when it comes to setting up my devices. I am going to have to try to hard wire it to my lap top each time I want to print, and hope for the best. But that is NOT why I bought this printer.

Functionally it is pretty basic.The biggest problem i had with it - after some time of inactivity (2/4/8 hours) it ""shuts down"". If it's on Wifi - it turns wifi connection off. No way to wake it up over network. No way to disable this behavior.Touching the screen supposed to wake it up, however it can't reconnect to wifi. Internal checks recommend to ""turn my router on"". Seems like it turns the Wifi card off and then can't turn it back on.The only way to re-connect is to hold the power button for some time until it's fully shut down, then turn it back on and wait for it to boot up and connect back to wifi (takes another 2 minutes).Another issue is the phone app. It doesn't let you do anything unless you create HP account and login with it. OS X application is whole another story. to start using this app you have to authenticate by logging into your HP account, it's done by opening a web brower and navigating it to HP login screen. if you're not using Safary as a default browser, it will give you a hard time.

I checked it out on some YouTube videos for setup and replacing toner cartridges and everything was so simple to do.  I only use Macs and the Color LaserJet Pro was supposedly compatible with macOS.  So, I took the printer out of the box, ran the initial setup, checked the toner cartridges, put in some paper, ran the print demo, connected to my 2.4 GHz WiFi Network, and printed a one-page PDF file from my 2015 MacBook Pro in another room.  I didn't need to install any HP drivers or anything else.  The printer was instantly recognized on my network and was ready to go after a minute or so of initialization.  Now the LaserJet Pro connects and prints instantly whenever I turn it on.I have to say this printer puts out some beautiful print and it will likely be the last printer I will ever need.  I was blown away by the color-print demo.  I don't know why I waited so long to buy a decent laser printer.  I don't think this printer is expensive at all and as long as the toner cartridges stay working, I don't mind paying the price of genuine HP toner cartridges.  It will probably take me years to use up the toner in those cartridges and I even bought a spare black toner cartridge just in case.  I am honestly pleased with this Color LaserJet Pro and I highly recommend it for basic print jobs.  Printing from my Mac running Mojave OS was a breeze.  I don't think printing gets any easier than this.  I'm going to play around with it a bit, such as printing from my smartphone or my other Macs.  I basically use my MacBook Pro laptop daily to do everything, so that's all I need to print from.  I really didn't need a color laser printer, but now I have one if I ever need to print something in color.  For me, it's totally worth it if I'm going to use it for years.  The printer came in handy right away, as I need to return a corrupted PNY SSD to Amazon, so I printed the return shipment code to give to the UPS store.  I had to give this printer a 5-star rating.  I don't see any cons for the short-term.  If it keeps on working as it is, then it's perfect.I bought this Color LaserJet Pro as a replacement printer for some older crappy, multi-function HP Color-Jet printer I had been using over the past few years.  I rarely print anything, so on occasion (every few months), whenever I needed to print or copy something important, the ink-jet cartridge was either partially clogged or dried out.  That's even after I removed the ink-jet cartridges, used the nozzle cover, and placed them in plastic ZipLoc bags.  It drove me bonkers and so I decided to trash that freaking ink-jet printer.  No more ink-jets for me.  I wasn't trying to save money.  It's just that I rarely printed documents and didn't realize there was a problem with those crappy ink-jet cartridges always getting clogged no matter how carefully I treated them.  My advice is... Stay away from ink-jet printers for document printing unless you're going to use them every day.",https://www.amazon.com/HP-Laserjet-3301fdw-Wireless-499Q5F/product-reviews/B0CTW43KHQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1

I finally decided to purchase a color laser printer. Thus far, I have been impressed with the printer itself. One of the huge improvements is the and it appears the laser and inkjet line. Is the ability to use several connectivity options. It seems HP has learned from their mistakes that just a wireless connection just does not cut it. This and also several inkjet printers give you the ability to choose wireless, ethernet and more importantly USB. Yes I know it is a little backwards but, if you have connectivity issues with your wireless connection you are out of luck in printing. Thus USB is a well appreciated addon! The printer performs very well and of course it be a color laser even better. Of course the toner as well as inkjet consumables have to be HP with their chip otherwise it will not work. Also it is my opinion not not waste your time with HP Instaink. I can't say that the toner have the same attributes as the injet cartages but they use a different chip to tell HP that you are running out of ink so it can be replenished by them. The problem with that is if you should decide to cancel and you happed to just got new cartridges you can not use them. You will require to purchase regular ones thus wasting your money with the ones you have.

I do need the A-I-O capability (I am of a generation that still faxes stuff), and color.  This printer just hit all the check-boxes and it is a bit smaller than the old Epson!  Fits nicely in the cubby next to my desk!  And the price-point was good.PRO- It was easy to set up.  Win10 found it and installed both the drivers and control programs as soon as it came online.- Prints FAST!  Well, it is, after all, a laser printer- Has it's own Email address so I can send stuff to it for printing.  I also was able to lock down that Email address to only receive information from specific Email addresses.- The replacement toner is not much more expensive than the multi-pack of ink for the old printer.  I remember when toner was a FORTUNE!!!CON- Somewhat louder... okay a LOT louder than the Epson.  Sounded like a vacuum cleaner turning on the first time I fired it up.  But only for the duration of the print, then it quiets down to nothing.- The LCD display is nearly impossible to read and operate.  The screen is small and I had to be, like, right on top of it to read.  The screen lacks sensitivity - I found I had to pound on the representative information a couple of times for it to register.  But, okay, it's now set up and I am done, and it looks like I can now do the rest through the HP Smart App.I have not downloaded and installed the dedicated HP software for the printer - I am sure that a lot of the functions though the LCD would be duplicated there, but I don't like having a lot of extra apps on the PC if I don't need to use them frequently.  As I mentioned, Win10 found the drivers and control program for me.  The HP Smart Print app seems to work nicely, and I have that installed on my PC and i-Stuff devices. Being a retired IT professional, I like when the user interface is similar across multiple platforms, and the HP Smart Print app allows that - I know what to look for and where.It was nice, too, that when I was done setting up my printer, the HP user site already had the printer information (type, Email address and serial number) there, along with the warranty coverage information.  Thank you!  I HATE when, after setting up something, I then have to go and type all that into a corporate site for coverage!So I got almost 10 years out of the Epson - let's see if I can get the same out of this HP!All in all, pleased.Oh, and printing photos in documents... OUTSTANDING!!!!  Nice to see color on paper that looks like it does on the screen!So... all in all, a good printer for the price!  If that changes, I will revisit my review!",https://www.amazon.com/HP-Laserjet-3301fdw-Wireless-499Q5F/product-reviews/B0CTW43KHQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1

It was easy to install and configure.  I was up and running in approximately an hour.  My only real issue was that the scanner defaulted to WIA when TWAIN is what my File Center software uses.  Not a problem.  This color laser supports both and HP had the driver I needed.  Jut went out to their well organized support site and there it was.Printing from my iPhone and iPad was easy.  As this is replacing an old Brother that didn’t have that capability, this is a big step up for me.  I’m not getting rid of the Brother as it still works well, but it will mainly do black&white from here on.The print image is sharp.  I needed to print some landscape designs that were made for large format printing and I easily read all but the smallest detail.  For the super small detail, with the help of a magnifying glass, that print info was also very sharp.  Maybe if I had my eyes from 40 years ago I could have seen it.The printer is quiet.  In a room full of equipment that is important.Probably my only critique is removing printed pages.  The holding surface needs a little dip to make it easier for those of us with sausage fingers.  I got used to it quick enough but would have liked a little dip in the surface to make it easier.The printer comes with very old software and I tested both the wireless printing as well as the email to the printer option.  As always, HP has a bunch of available forms and crafts.  With land line phones almost obsolete, the mobile fax option is important.  For me, it is important only one time per year.Overall this a a very solid color laser for home office use.",https://www.amazon.com/HP-Laserjet-3301fdw-Wireless-499Q5F/product-reviews/B0CTW43KHQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1

To get it to connect to my wifi I had to go through the little screen on the printer and then print off the stats page. From there I got the MAC address that I needed to add to my MAC address filtering. Then the IP address let me add the printer via manual IP. Then it would find the printer otherwise it would scan and never find it. That isn't acceptable. Second I still haven't figured out how to have it scan to a network folder. There is no example with their online video demo. I get a constant error. However opening the software I can at least click on the scan function to accomplish this.Over all the printer seems rather nice but the software is not intuitive nor too user friendly. HP really needs to clean it up. The user manual is basically worthless and for the price I paid for it they could have done a lot more. I feel that HP is more geared at giving network engineers a headache installing their products that they forget that regular folks like me just want a decent printer and are not techno wizards.The upside from what I've read you can roll back the firmware to a previous version that will let you use third party toner cartridges. I haven't tried it yet and as little as I print that would be a good two years down the road. So once I can do that, then I'm sure I'll be rather happy with it.I chose a laserjet as I' so sick of the mess of refilling ink cartridges but more so clogged dried out print heads. Even an eco tank models can get a bit expensive and add the cost of a new print head and I'm into the price of this printer. The way I print, I go through a print head about every year. The last print head I got didn't work as it was of poor quality and took 3 weeks for it to arrive. So going with a laserjet should bypass this problem. So for those who are interested in this printer the hardware seems fine. It's the software that is problematic. So expect a headache and watching a few youtube videos should get you up and running. Otherwise I'm rather excited to begin using it. One thing I do not know is if the scanner will continue to work even if the printer is out of toner. Usually in inkjets no ink bricks the entire unit and praying this doesn't happen with this printer. So my final initial opinion is the printer is decent but HP really fell down on the job in their software.01/13/2024Update. The printer is still working fine. Still using the original toner cartridges. Some things I did notice. Whenever you lose power you must turn off then on again. Then the printer will scan fir your network, find it and login. Else the printer won't find your network as it takes longer for the router and PC to boot than the printer.Now scanning to a network feature. I finally got it to work. First you have to create a sharable folder. Then to login. You have to use your Microsoft username. It's a pain and recommend that once successful to write it all down for future reference.Other than that I've had no problems with this printer and still very satisfied with its performance. Another feature that is overlooked is the ability to roll back the firmware. The previous version which you can download for free will let you use third party toners without bricking the printer. I haven't done it but there are numerous YouTube videos demonstrating this.Final thoughts, very nice printer but the software and instructions are a bit lacking and confusing.",https://www.amazon.com/HP-Laserjet-3301fdw-Wireless-499Q5F/product-reviews/B0CTW43KHQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1

Unknown,RL16ZWDRDNUEI,Positive,"Marshall Emberton II Portable Bluetooth Speaker, Black & Brass",4.7,5.0,"10,080","A few months ago I had an epiphany.  When I was a kid my father loved to have the best in sound equipment in the house, and I would play with graphic equalizers and lay in the floor looking for the best position between the giant speakers to experiment how to better enjoy the music.Today, I hear music in monophonic audio in an old JBL Charge 3 speaker (don't tell my dad, he would be ashame of me).So I started to get better equipment.  Now, I live in a small apartment with thin walls in a 3rd floor, so, big amplifiers and so are out of the question, but at least I could get better bluetooth speakers, so I tried the Marshall Emberton II.To say that I impressed with the sound would be an understatement.  With out-of-the-box settings, the sound is more than detailed.  80s and 90s music sound outstanding although, Peter Cetera's Glory of Love and Toto's Africa vocals sound as I never heard them before, they are sharp and strong, sometimes detracting just a little from the overall sound (keywords here, really, just a little).This brings me to my first recommendation: do not mess with your applications equalizers if you don't know what you are doing.  This speakers were clearly designed to use the manufacturer equalizer settings (more on this later).  I have youtube music and amazon prime music (yeah, I know, no spotify), and my sound with the latter was to heavy on bass, to the point of drowning the music and feeling almost distorting.  Tron: Legacy's soundtrack sounded specially dreadful, as Daftpunk uses heavy bass in their electronic music for that specific music.  I then set the equalization in Amazon Prime Music to flat.  It was a different performance altogether.  I could ever hear some slight effects they used, that I had not noticed before.Now, one down for the application.  Bluetooth pairing used Google Fast Pair, which was seamless and impressive (it shows appears to be a custom Marshall little window, so, it looks cool), but the application takes forever to actually ""discover"" the device, even when it is already paired.When it finally discover it (which was not too long, but took a couple of turning on and off the speaker), the application notified me of a firmware upgrade, which I proceeded to install.  The installation failed miserably, so, I temporarily stopped that effort, which I retook successfully a day later.  The update was surprisingly big in size, taking around 5 minutes to download, and the application simply marked the update successful while the speaker was still rebooting, which took a few seconds more than what I feel comfortable with, but it went through, and after that, the application again took surprisingly long to detect the speaker.To end that topic, the equalization settings are definitely underwhelming, with only three modes: Marshall, Voice and Push, of which I have only tried Marshall as everybody else says that Voice is just for podcast and such and Push increases bass at the expense of all the other sound bands quality.Lesson learned: unless too picky, when using this speaker, leave your apps equalizers on flat, their profile is that good.Now, to the hardware itself, people will notice this little wonder.  Using the nostalgia factor with the Marshall amplifier design was a touch of genius, and the brass button on top is the cherry on top.  Some reviews complain about a single button approach to multifunction (power, volume, forward-back, bluetooth pairing has another almost invisible button, which fits because you are not changing your pairing frequently).  If we can handle touch control on over-head and in-ear speakers, this button is a piece of cake.My only complain in this department is that, at least for me, an old guy, the signs indicating the functions around the button, being carved in the black speaker, which has texture, are for all intent and purposes invisible, but once you get accustomed, an use the logo as a positional reference that's not a problem anymore.And finally, the little caveat.  Single speaker, stereo sound.  Let that sink in.Done?  Ok, they achieve this trick by separating the sound left and right with drivers back and front respectively (or was it the other way around? well, you get my point).  Stereo suffers a little (not too much) because both sources are incredibly close, but it brings this caveat.  This speaker should not be set as others, against walls, like in shelf, and so, because you end up drowning one side.The best position for this speaker is in the center of the audio stage, and if you want to appreciate the sound, you should point one side (not the front or back) to you.  that way both sources are equally distanced from you so you get a better balance.If you are ok with the caveats this product is worth the price, I definitely recommend it.",https://www.amazon.com/Marshall-Emberton-Portable-Bluetooth-Speaker/product-reviews/B09XXW54QG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1

I bought this Em II to mainly listen to my true crime podcasts in my bedroom. Easy & seamless Bluetooth connection to my iPhone 14max. Easy straightforward use for controls on the unit. I really didn’t need to look at the instructions with that. Smooth use there.To test the sound quality I streamed some mesic. The sound quality for music is fine’ish considering the size of speaker. It’s fine for background music if you’re flexible on sound quality as long as you don’t play loudly, at that point the music will frazzle out. So limited, not surprising. Podcast quality is definitely an improvement from my phone’s speaker and in line with the price point, in general. I think it should be about $25 less.  The app is useless. I guess I expected something from the app. I’m at a loss for the point of it. I tried it out on my phone. It continued so say my phone Bluetooth was not on. Even as I was literally playing music through it. I did all the stuff. Restart, reconnect etc. Reviewed the booklet, Nothing. Everything re the speaker and phone working fine.

Most surprisingly, it’s even decent  for streaming video and for cord cutters who can take advantage of the HDMI port to connect to a larger display.The basics:  It comes with Windows 11 Home in S mode, but you can easily switch out of S mode if you need to install additional programs not found on the Microsoft store. I turned it off with 4 minutes of use, so that’s a breeze.  And of course, this laptop features a 14-inch 1920 x 1080 display, an Intel Celeron N4020 processor, and 4GB of RAM.**Here are some of the highlights of the HP 14:*** **Great for basic tasks:** The HP 14 can handle basic tasks such as browsing the web, checking email, and using productivity software, but with only 4GB of RAM, I  experienced some  slowdowns when I had many tabs open in my browser or was running multiple programs at once.* **Long battery life:** The laptop can last up to 6.5 hours on a single charge. I was definitely impressed!* **Comfortable keyboard:** The keyboard is bouncy with a generous click and plenty of room for typing.if you like firmer keyboards, this one may not be your jam.* **SD card slot:** The HP 14 includes an SD card slot, which is a rarity for laptops in this price range.perfect for me,because my trail cam’s card can be emptied daily with ease!* **HDMI port:** as mentioned, this is great  for cord cutters who want to connect to a larger display or projector. My last cheap laptop was twice the price of this one and didn’t have an hdmi or a card reader.**Here are some things to keep in mind:*** **Small touchpad:** The touchpad is small and can be difficult to use.* **Dim screen:** The screen is a bit dim and I found it impossible to use outside no matter how I adjusted the display settings.* **Low storage:** 64GB of storage may not be enough for some users.* **Limited RAM:** 4GB of RAM  limits multitasking capabilities.I don’t know yet if those last two items are upgradable, but I’ll check into it if things get bogged down over the next few weeks!**Overall, the HP 14 is a great laptop for students, casual users, and anyone looking for a basic laptop under $200, especially if you don't plan on running multiple programs at once.  However, if you need a laptop for more demanding tasks, you may want to consider a model with more RAM.**",https://www.amazon.com/HP-Micro-edge-Microsoft-14-dq0040nr-Snowflake/product-reviews/B0947BJ67M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1

Flaws are mainly in packaging. Product comes with NO instructions, No Quick Start guide, No enclosed parts list, and worst... no customer support phone number or web address.

Overall, I give it 5.0 out of 5.0 stars. This is an initial review as the camera was set up not long ago.Likes:1. Quality camera resolution. Of course this can be dependent on your internet speed as it is connected via WiFi.2. Night vision works great.3. Motion detection works great and is highly adjustable for range and sensitivity.4. Alerts of any motion is great and can be adjusted to your preferences.5. App for remote viewing is good and easy to use basic stuff. Some adjustments when you have it integrated to the Ring Alarm can get more complicated.6. Audio receive and transmit is great.7. The Pan and Tilt features are such an advantage over the old models. Now you can swivel side-to-side, up-and-down from the app in your phone or tablet. Plus, after viewing is done, the camera will reset to the default position, which I really like. If you want a more permanent adjustment, just physically adjust the camera.8. A little more weight to the camera versus the older models that were too lightweight. If I bumped the cord of the old ones, it would jostle the position and angle of view. The bew model minimizes this with a little more heft, which will keep it stable when it Pan-Tilts.Dislike:- None so far for this camera. I do have some complaints for may aging Ring system. Sometimes I felt that when you get an alert and try to view the alert (never tried with this specific camera yet), it would be delayed before you can get a live feed. By the time you see anything, the person could be long gone. Then when you go to review the footage, it takes long to load.Overall, this Ring Pan-Tilt Indoor Camera has been great initially, 5.0 out of 5.0 stars. We shall see in the long-term.

For the most part the ring app has always worked as designed. I have been waiting a while for them to come up with a pan-capable camera. It is functional, but aesthetically lacking.Pros:- pans smoothly and quietly- home position lock. After live viewing the cam and panning around to see the room; once you exit the live view the Ring Cam was adjust back to the default viewing position you choose during setup.- low light color (image1) and night vision (image2) are clear- built in privacy cover, that once slid to lock position, turns off video and audio- install was a breeze; go to your ring add, add new device, scan the QR code and follow instructions. Was probably the smoothest install of a Ring device for me as of yet.Cons:- the build of the device is kind of bulky. It is clear the decided to add to an existing design instead of creating an entirely new one.

I find these tilt cams to be the better of the two not just because they tilt and turn, but because the base is weighed. On the regular indoor cams I have to make weighed bases for them to make sure they are stable on flat surfaces. Without the weighted base the stiffness of the power cord or having the power cord touched can effect the placement and direction of the camera view. While making the bases isn't hard, it does take some time and efffort.The tilt cams have nicely weighed bases and they give you the ability to change the view of camera. They sit much more firmly on a flat surface than the non-tilt cameras. They operate silently too. The tilt cam is about an inch taller than the non-tilt cam, but when I add a weighted base to a non-tilt cam the difference is less than half an inch. The additional $20 for the tilt cam is money well spent.The tilt camera has a couple of features that need improvement. The first is that when the camera is started or reset it spins and tilts back and forth. This exercise means that the camera has to be set where it has plenty of room or the tilting back and forth will knock it over.  You're not going to be able to tuck this in a tight place on a shelf. The other feature, that is on all Ring indoor cams, is that there is no way to turn off the little blue light indiciating that the camera is recording. I understand why Ring does this, but if you don't want the feature you'll need to place a small piece of electrical tape over the blue indicator light.I like these tilt cameras and if I need a new Indoor Cam I will only buy the tilt version. Unless you are trying to tuck the camera in a tight space or maybe plan to wall mount it the $20 extra for the tilt cam is a worth it.",https://www.amazon.com/Ring-Pan-Tilt-Indoor-Cam-White/product-reviews/B0CG2VS5FD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1

I already had a Ring camera that covers the living room and front door. This one covers my dining and kitchen areas and the doors that exit from them. By using the pan and tilt features, it also allows me to see some of the “hidey holes” where my dog frequently goes when he’s home alone. For its fundamental purpose, to cover the doors from the dining room and kitchen, I’m not disappointed.But I have learned that using my phone to pan and tilt the camera is a little problematic. When both are on the same WiFi at home, the screen controls immediately move the camera. But when I’m away, so that my phone is either on a cell service or another’s WiFi, there’s a very definite lag before the camera starts to move, and another lag when I try to stop its movement. This isn’t horrible, but it’s a little disappointing, hence the 4 stars.On the positive side, it (like my other Ring devices) was extraordinarily easy to set up. It takes no skills at all—just follow the Ring app’s very brief instructions to add a device, and within moments, it’s up and working.",https://www.amazon.com/Ring-Pan-Tilt-Indoor-Cam-White/product-reviews/B0CG2VS5FD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1

Ha sicuramente un buon impatto visivo, un'estetica gradevole, colori e materiali moderni, un peso notevole a causa del pacco batterie all' interno, una buona stabilità nella base e una luce mediamente intensa.---Ha una proiezione sul piano orizzontale, di conseguenza va collocato ad una certa altezza da terra per sfruttare il telo o la parete a noi frontale. Ha il sistema di fuoco automatico,sebbene impieghi un bel po' di secondi: se notiamo qualche sfocatura,possiamo agire con il telecomando e migliorare l'asse ottico ancora di più. Copre distanze superiori ad 1 metro, altrimenti non focalizza bene.---Diciamo che ho perso un po' di tempo per trovare la lingua (è arrivato con caratteri cinesi). Mentre lo collegavo alla Rete Wifi, per ben 4 volte ho dovuto inserire la password, perchè ogni tot minuti la perdeva. Mi son reso conto che è privo di sistema operativo e non può navigare in Internet. Ho provato a connetterlo con lo Smartphone tramite Miracast Android, in quanto vi era specificato in una schermata che potesse farlo, ma niente, non ci si connette proprio. Ho dovuto scaricare quindi una APP che si chiama Yaber ,ma nonostante telefono e proiettore fossero collegati al medesimo modem non sono riuscito ad andare in condivisione schermo. Per cui non ho potuto testarlo con immagini, musica, video in definizione 4K e via dicendo, nemmeno sul web ho potuto navigare,niente. In pratica funziona solo con una prolunga HDMI fornita in dotazione, operando da semplice monitor a parete, e nemmeno a soffitto, in quanto se è coricato non può smaltire il forte calore che proviene dalla ventola sottostante.---Il telecomando poi non ne parliamo: su 5 cliccate una la perde. Come se il sistema si bloccasse di tanto in tanto, per poi riprendere vita.---La cosa più stramba è anche la maniglia, che collocata sotto per rialzarlo leggermente dal piano orizzontale fa si che lo schermo sia obliquo verso destra, per cui è necessario inserire anche dei cartoncini per ispessire la maniglia sotto e raddrizzare l'immagine. Un'assurdità.---Se viene spostato due millimetri, il sistema mi richiede di correggere immediatamente il trapezio, il fuoco, etc., etc., e questi 'warning' diventano una palla al piede.---In linea di massima, nonostante abbiano sfruttato la sezione audio JBL , non è che vi sia chissà quale effetto impattante, non è che con due altoparlantini da pochi cm. ci si possa realizzare un concerto all'aperto.

This is the first such projector I have ever owned so I have nothing to compare it to.  I felt the instructions could have used some improvement.  There is a full manual online but again I think it fell short.  In the end, I just had to plug it in and play with it.  Initially I had a problem setting it up because I couldn’t get it to connect to wifi.  It said ""connecting"" and then just stayed on that screen.  I wasn’t sure if it was doing something like updating in the background but  eventually I gave up and cancelled it.  When I went back later to try again, it said my wifi signal was “not good”.  I was in the room the furthest away from my router but other devices have no issue connecting there and were connected when I was trying to get the projector to connect.  You need to connect to wifi to update the firmware which is recommended when you first get it.  When I moved to the same room as my router, it said my signal was “good” and I was able to do the updates.  Note the projector did not prompt me to update it, I had to go into settings and find it.  When it finished updating, it just shut off.  Initially I wasn’t sure if that was part of the process but when it didn’t come back on after waiting, I realized it wasn’t.When I tried to use NFC to connect to my phone, my phone kept prompting me to go to the Play Store and download the Yaber app which I didn’t want to do.  Eventually I downloaded and installed the app but I still couldn’t get NFC to work as it was still prompting me to download the app.  I was able to screen mirror with the app and I was able to connect a Chromecast with Google TV via HDMI and play video.  The picture looked very clear.  The project auto focuses and that generally worked really well though one time when I turned it on, it was slow to focus and I couldn't read the screen.  Sound was good but watching a movie it seemed odd that it was coming from the projector and not from speakers near the screen.  Of course that would be the case with any projector and something to get used to.  The sound was better when I changed it to movie setting. There are three sound modes.The projector felt a little heavy to me for a portable projector but I guess that has to do with having a battery.  It has a carry handle which is nice.  The handle also doubles as a stand which is convenient.  It says it runs for 2.5 hrs on battery but I haven’t had a chance to try that out yet.  The power cord that comes with isn’t that long so that could be useful and not just outdoors.  I do like that you can connect to it multiple ways including HDMI, USB, NFC and wifi though NFC didn’t work properly for me.  It comes with an HDMI cable.  It has a remote control to operate it but it isn’t always responsive and I found at times have to hit a button multiple times.Overall,  I liked the projector once I got it working but it was a little frustrating getting there and I still haven't figured out the NFC issue.",https://www.amazon.com/Yaber-T2-Projector-Bluetooth-Compatible/product-reviews/B0D69M55YM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1

Sin embargo, cuando analizamos el contraste y el rendimiento en exteriores, especialmente en condiciones diurnas, se presentan algunos desafíos.Contraste y calidad de imagen: El proyector cuenta con 450 lúmenes ANSI, lo que proporciona imágenes nítidas y vibrantes en ambientes oscuros o con poca luz pero por lo que en interiores o durante la noche, el proyector rinde notablemente bien, proyectando una imagen clara y con colores vivos. Sin embargo, su desempeño disminuye cuando se usa en exteriores durante el día. Uno de los puntos que destacan es que, al funcionar con batería, el brillo se reduce para ahorrar energía, lo que afecta aún más la calidad de la proyección en ambientes con luz natural.Para aprovechar al máximo este proyector en exteriores, es mejor usarlo al atardecer o en la noche, cuando la falta de luz ambiental no interfiere con la proyección. Durante el día, incluso con sombras o bajo techados, la luminosidad podría no ser suficiente para garantizar una experiencia óptima.Rendimiento en exteriores: Un aspecto que se destaca en varias reseñas es su portabilidad y la duración de su batería, que lo hace ideal para llevar al exterior y disfrutar de películas o videojuegos en una pantalla grande. Sin embargo, al usarlo fuera, la visibilidad dependerá en gran medida de las condiciones lumínicas. Por lo tanto, aunque es un excelente compañero para actividades al aire libre como campings o reuniones en el jardín, su uso está más limitado a horas sin luz solar directa.Si bien este proyector es excepcional en términos de sonido, portabilidad y facilidad de uso, su capacidad de proyección durante el día es su principal limitación. Con un rendimiento óptimo en situaciones de baja luz, es ideal para proyecciones nocturnas, donde el contraste y los colores realmente destacan. Durante el día o con luz ambiental, su desempeño se ve comprometido, por lo que no es la mejor opción si lo que se busca es una proyección clara en exteriores en plena luz del día.Sobre la conectividad, puedo decir que va bien provisto:Conexiones físicas:HDMI: Incluye un puerto HDMI compatible con ARC (Audio Return Channel) y CEC, lo que permite una conexión fácil con otros dispositivos como consolas de videojuegos, reproductores Blu-ray, ordenadores y decodificadores de TV, etcUSB: Puedes conectar pendrives y otros dispositivos USB para reproducir contenido multimedia directamente desde el proyector. Soporta sistemas de archivos FAT32 y NTFS, aunque no reconoce exFAT.Puerto LAN (RJ45): Para conexiones de red por cable, ideal si prefieres una conexión más estable que el WiFi.Salida de audio: Te permite conectar sistemas de sonido externos si necesitas más potencia de audio o deseas usar altavoces externos en lugar de los incorporados, aún que no veo que haga falta, porque suena muy bienConectividad inalámbrica:WiFi 6: El proyector admite WiFi 6, lo que le da una ventaja en cuanto a velocidad y estabilidad de conexión para transmitir contenido desde tu red doméstica o desde plataformas de streaming (siempre que esté conectado a un dispositivo externo con esta capacidad).Bluetooth: Permite utilizar el proyector como un altavoz Bluetooth independiente, conectando tu smartphone o cualquier dispositivo de audio. También puedes conectar auriculares o altavoces Bluetooth para mejorar la experiencia auditiva.NFC: Esta tecnología simplifica la conexión con dispositivos compatibles. Solo tienes que tocar tu teléfono en la parte superior del proyector para emparejarlo rápidamente y comenzar a proyectar o transmitir contenido desde el móvil.Vamos, que por conectividad va genial, lástima que no tenga más potencia, porque de lumens va un poco justo.",https://www.amazon.com/Yaber-T2-Projector-Bluetooth-Compatible/product-reviews/B0D69M55YM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1

Se nota que entra en juego la marca líder JBL.La calidad de video también es buena, pero solo con total oscuridad. Con luz en el ambiente noto que le falta fuerza a la lámpara. A un precio de 399.99€ a la hora de solicitarlo esperaba más en cuanto a la potencia de la lámpara. Además cuando la película es oscura la imagen empeora bastante.Los puntos positivos son (aparte de los altavoces):-el diseño con asa, que puedes bajar para usarlo de soporte y elevar la imagen.-El enfoque automático y la corrección trapezoidal, que en mi caso he notado que solo funciona bien cuando la pantalla donde quieres proyectar la imagen contrasta mucho con el fondo, sino le cuesta cuadrar la imagen.-No tener que preocuparme por que entre polvo al interior de la lente, porque va sellado. (A los anteriores les ponía una funda cuando  no los usaba).Los puntos negativos.-Me costó mucho conectarlo al wifi la 1a vez. Indican que hay que actualizar el software nada más estrenarlo y para ello hay que conectarlo a internet. Tuve que reiniciarlo de fábrica estando conectado por ethernet y ahí sí salió una pantalla de ""system is updating"", y después ya me dejó conectar el wifi.-Necesidad de mucha oscuridad para disfrutar de la imagen al 100% (a menos que la película sea oscura).-La batería, aunque en principio es un plus, al reducir la intensidad de la luz no anima nada a usarla. Es preferible tirar de cable. Además solo da para ver una peli de hora y media aprox, si se alarga te puedes quedar sin ver el final.-En la descripción se promociona un stick-dongle que no va incluido, cuando por el precio que tiene considero que debería venir integrado.En resumen. Es un buen proyector para usar en oscuridad.

I absolutely love watching movies or tv shows on a huge screen and my TV's seldom get used these days. When I had the chance to order and review the Yaber T2 Outdoor Projector I jumped at the chance.There are three main things you look for in a projector, the projected image (size, resolution, sharpness, color, brightness), Connectivity (Wifi, Bluetooth, manual ports) and the build quality. Obviously price is an important variable too and that can affect the priorities of the aforementioned attributes!The Yaber (who came up with that brand name, seriously...) ticks a lot of boxes. The native resolution, whilst not being 4k is full HD at 1080p. I find the image to be pretty good when viewing 1080p content. Absolutely no issues there for me. Brightness nets out at just 450 lumens which is on the low side. You 100% will not be using this during the day or even at sunset. This is a night time projector! The model I have features WiFi 6 and Bluetooth, but has no operating system so to speak. I have added a Fire stick to cover all apps and it's been perfect, just need to consider how you power the stick and have a stable wifi connection outside. There is a matching Google dongle from Yaber sold separately but I haven't looked into that. Another alternative is to stream directly from your phone or tablet wirelessly or via USB cable. I have not tried that yet.Audio wise, this thing has JBL speakers and they are great! Dolby audio is onboard to help pick up and define the sounds. Power wise this is 16 watts in total for the inbuilt speaker. I really enjoy the sound given how small the unit is. It's not the loudest but if you are outside with not a lot of noise in the background you will need no external speaker (unless you really want to amp it up).The big selling point for this is the battery inside! I wanted this for a 4th July BBQ with friends. We have a patio with a large white wall and I thought it would be cool for everyone to watch sports and a movie outside at night, which we did and everyone was super impressed with this projector. The battery is advertised to last 2 and a half hours. In reality we got to the end of a 90 minute movie and we had to plug it in. There was a little juice left so i'd like to say you could probably get a 2 hour movie on the battery or 2 tv shows.The build quality is very good and it feels reliably well made. There is apparently a 3 year repair warranty and 6 month returns. That seems a little too good to believe but could also be an indicator of how reliable these machines are.Given the sub $400 price tag, this is a great option for outdoor viewing and I can highly recommend this.",https://www.amazon.com/Yaber-T2-Projector-Bluetooth-Compatible/product-reviews/B0D69M55YM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1

These headphones were very comfortable and the battery lasts forever. It also charges fast. It’s  build was nice just plastic and kind of cheap feeling. It tended to slip a lot on my head but it didn’t make my ears warm or anything or yank hairs out. It also doesn’t squish your ears/head. So on the comfort aspect 4/5. The sound however is another story. First of all, if you play music above 20% volume everyone can hear it because the sounds leaks. When connected to any Apple product the sound diminishes greatly in quality. You can barely hear whatever you’re playing (again at levels that don’t leak sound) and it sounds very far away and muffled. I commute a lot so this was a deal breaker for me. However on my HP laptop it worked like a dream, bass was great, but it still leaked sounds when playing at half the volume or less. Again, that was super annoying. Connectivity wise everything went smoothly and this far I haven’t had an issue. The aware mode is kind of staticky and windy sounding and not really good like the AirPods Pro. The noise cancellation is decent but you can still hear a lot of things and doesn’t really cancel much out, the AirPods have much better noice cancellation. Overall, it depends on what you’re wanting to use it for. These slip a lot on my head when working out and for commuting just wasn’t what I was looking for. I got them on sale and still don’t feel $200 justifies the cost for what I got. Will be returning giving three starts because of comfort.",https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth/product-reviews/B0CCZC9J1V/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1
Unknown,R3J47OJ199W8H6,Critical,"Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth Headphones, Wireless Headphones, Over Ear Noise Cancelling Headphones with Mic, Up To 24 Hours of Battery Life, White Smoke",4.6,3.0,"5,603","I purchased these headphones for the purpose of working from home in a call center environment for 8hr a day. My main reasons for purchasing were: to go wireless, and increase comfort. I am often in meetings and calls for hours at a time, and the headphones my organization provided were painful.On my first day of use, I noticed a couple issues. First issue is that on Windows and Mac the microphone volume is far too low. Nobody on Microsoft Teams or my call center software could hear me. I needed to install a separate application to artificially boost the microphone by around 20dB. Second issue I noticed is regarding having two devices connected at the same time. Example: If you are actively streaming audio from a Windows computer, and then your iPhone gets a text notification, the headphones will cut the audio from the Windows computer to play the iPhone notification. When this happens, your Bluetooth connection either drops, or the audio quality gets very bad (crackling, stutters, etc) and you need to disconnect/reconnect devices.On my second day of use, I experienced random drops in audio quality and needed to power off/on the headphones 3 times.Bose has many suggestions and troubleshooting steps in their support articles, which I have gone through. That being said, these headphones are fine. I will keep them and enjoy them for my work (when they are working) and enjoy them for traveling. That being said, I do wish I would have gone with a Microsoft Teams certified device instead for my purposes. This product appears to be more intended for casual use as opposed to professional use.The sound quality is very good compared to my Sennheiser HD598. Audio is very clear, especially in the mid to high frequencies. Other reviews mention a lack of bass, but I found the bass to be MORE than enough. The active noise cancellation has a huge impact on music listening; I feel like the sound stage is very wide as I can hear many details in songs I haven't picked up on before.Noise cancellation is insanely good. I don't have a great basis for comparison, but it's almost eerie how silent the world is when you have these on. At most, I can barely hear a super loud fan a few feet away, or I barely hear the faucet when washing dishes. I look forward to using these while doing chores around the house!Comfort and fit is great for only 2 days of use. They are much more comfortable than I expected, as I have a big head and typically need to ""break in"" headphones a little bit longer. I had these headphones on for hours and they didn't give me any issues.Overall, despite the annoying connection issues I have with these things I am going to keep them. I like them enough to where I am willing to work around these issues for now. The next time I need to travel these are going to be a life saver. I can't wait to finally sleep on planes! If you're working from home, I would recommend seeking a Microsoft Teams certified pair of headphones.",https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth/product-reviews/B0CCZC9J1V/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1

Pick them up in a couple days and the battery is 0 again. They charge kind of slowly. You cannot use them while being charged, and the headphones don’t even connect to the app while charging. They go into complete ghost mode. This results in me not being able to use the headphones as often as I’d like to use them, considering how much I paid. Also, this might not be good for a person with big ears. I feel like my ears are on the bigger side and after an hr or so of wearing these, it can start to feel some ear discomfort.  They use like 16 different commands, all through just 2 buttons, and I can’t ever remember the freakin Morse code secret handshake button dots and dashes they want me to remember to be able to take a call or use Siri. Volume is the easiest one, it has its own two dedicated buttons.Pros, they are comfortable, and the sound is good. Music sounds awesome.

The upper part on the headphones don't even rest on my head in the lowest position.Can hear the music external to the user which doesn’t happen with earbuds.Bose made a huge miss on this one. When resting the headphones around your neck, say like when waiting for your plane, the ear part turns up to rest comfortably against your next or shoulder. But why turn UP. The padded headphone is then facing up. So let’s say something gets spilled nearby or you are running through rain, it exposes the headphone and padding to damage.

However, I’ve encountered a recurring issue during takeoff: the headphones produce a lot of static feedback when the plane is ascending. This has happened on all eight flights I’ve taken since purchasing them, which is disappointing for such a premium product.In everyday use, the noise-canceling feature is effective but not perfect.

Unknown,R3F5OY3ZF4KW77,Positive,"Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth Headphones, Wireless Headphones, Over Ear Noise Cancelling Headphones with Mic, Up To 24 Hours of Battery Life, White Smoke",4.6,5.0,"5,603","First, let may say that I bought them during Prime Days, when they were only $199.99, which was a discount of $150!  So, they are an incredible value.I own many pair of headphones, including AirPod Max, Sonos Ace, Bose QC 45, and the Sony XM5’s. I also owned and sold the QuietComfort Ultra, which are way overpriced, and the main selling point (their spatial sound or whatever they call it) is a joke.  I don’t think it enhances the sound at all. In fact, music has an artificial quality when using it.  Additionally, I prefer the QuietComfort’s buttons to the Ultra’s touch controls, which seemed awkward.  The Bose QuietComfort are quickly becoming my favorite.  They sound better than all except the Apple AirPod Max.  They are noticeably better than the QC 45. The bass is definitely deeper and punchier. The highs and mids are also discernibly better. The highs are brighter and more crisp.  The 45’s require a lot of equalizer use, while the quietcomfort still require some tinkering, they require a lot less of it to achieve optimum sound.  The noise cancelling has also improved, though I would say both the Sony XM5’s and the Sonos Aces are a touch better at cancelling most noise.  The QuietComfort are the most-comfortable to wear, though they are no different than the 45’s in that regard.  They are extremely lightweight (though sturdy), and clamp down perfectly tight.  I can shake my head back and forth without them shifting, yet they’re not so tight as to prevent wearing them for an extended period of time.  I don’t work out, but I would imagine they’d maintain their fit during exercise. They also offer multi-point connectivity, and they (and the 45’s) are the only two pair to switch seamlessly between my LG TV and my iPhone.  The XM5’s require using the app, the Sonos don’t do it as easily as advertised and the AirPods Max don’t even offer multipoint functionality.  If you own a pair of 45’s and are looking for an upgrade, then I would say there’s not quite enough of a performance gap to justify the $349 price tag, however, if you catch them on sale for $199 like I did, then I would definitely recommend upgrading.  If you’re looking for your first pair, then I would definitely recommend the QuietComfort over all the others I mentioned, even at $349.  I hope that helps.

These wireless headphones are no exception.The sound is fantastic. Whether it's a podcast, film, audio book, or music, everything is detailed and clear. There is depth and although there is a good deal of high end, it is not harsh to my ears. There is enough bass for me with the default EQ setting. (If you aren't happy with the EQ, you can adjust it in the app.) I listen to everything from classical, blues, and jazz, to classic rock and progressive metal. It all sounds good through these headphones.Setup was quick and easy;no issues there at all. I mainly use these with my iPhone and iPad. Bluetooth seems solid even if I leave my phone or tablet at the other end of the house which is nice. I am very impressed with the battery life! I can easily go a day or two without charging and that's with pretty heavy use throughout the day and evening depending on what I'm up to.The earcups and headband are comfortable, they are lite, and the carry case is a nice touch. IT's small enough that it will be easy to travel with. I like that they updated their headphones with USB C.The noise cancelation is pretty good, however, they don't equal the Apple Airpods Max in that department. (That's not a deal braker for me but I thought I'd mention it all the same.)All in all, these are great and I would buy them again.Bose make excellent products!",https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth/product-reviews/B0CCZC9J1V/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1

Unknown,R1CKN589J52EL5,Positive,"Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth Headphones, Wireless Headphones, Over Ear Noise Cancelling Headphones with Mic, Up To 24 Hours of Battery Life, White Smoke",4.6,5.0,"5,603","This is my first pair of Bose headphones. Initial impressions before even putting them on was “Dang, these are expensive headphones,” and at $349.99, yes, they are. There’s hundreds of headphones on the market, many of them with noise cancelling, that are available for far less money. But, considering my first pair of ANC Headphones were the original Beats by Dr. Dre Studios, and adjusted for inflation since 2011, I paid $416 for those, these are certainly more than competitive. Also, there’s a reason that for the past several years, when people bring up noise cancelling headphones, they are usually talking about Sony or Bose as their reference point. They are quality. They do the job well. Let’s dive in.1. ANC2. Comfort3. Sound4. Build Quality5. Feature Set6. Who should buy these?Ok, so as I said, my previous ANC Headphones are the original Beats Studios, and my most recent over the ear headphones purchase was the Audio-Technica ATH-M50x back in 2017. I’ll be comparing these to my experience with the both of them. Maybe also in comparison to my gaming headset, the Razer Barracuda X.First off, the noise cancelling itself, since this lineup is called QUIETComfort. Pretty darn good. Honestly, I can’t say that it’s any better than my reference point of headphones from 2011, but still positive experience. Blocks out basically all voices (except the higher range like baby cries), and I couldn’t hear any other noise around me when in use. Can’t complain.Now for the QuietCOMFORT portion of the equation. Compared to both of my previous headphones, it’s a serious improvement. The Beats and Audio-Technica both were heavy over the top of my skull, creating discomfort over extensive sessions where I would shift the band forward and backward over my head to give a break to the affected area. My Razer Barracuda X are also lightweight, and up to this point were the most comfortable in this regards, but the Bose definitely have more padding on the band. That said, I still have experienced the same over the skull discomfort with these headphones, and the band has to be loosened to address it. Obviously, that means the headphones overall sit more loosely on my head and are less secure.The earcups have sufficient padding for my ears, and they don’t make contact, so though they are shallow, they aren’t as shallow as others I’ve owned where the speaker housings press against the outer cartilage of my ear. This, again makes for a comfortable experience over time. Like other headphones I’ve owned, definitely heat buildup inside the earcups, and these are no exception, with condensation gathering on the material. Yep, I was sweaty listening to these. But I live in the desert, so there’s that. Your experience may vary based on your location and if you run generally warm or not.The sound quality over playback is pleasant, and anything I’ve found unpleasant I can adjust easily with the Bose app to tune the EQ to my liking. I blame anything I haven’t liked to my various EQ settings (iOS, Spotify, Bose app combinations) and the source of the audio (Spotify streaming) more than the quality of the sound itself. Both my ATH-M50x and Barracuda X have mostly neutral sound, with the ATH being legitimate studio monitors being only slightly warm and the Barracuda having neutral with slight emphasis to bass for obvious reasons: gaming you want to hear footsteps, and higher bass emphasis aids immersion in game. Obviously, the Beats were very warm, and had bass emphasized beyond the Barracudas. So if I were to place the Bose in the comparison, I’d say its default sound is warm, not neutral, but definitely not as bass heavy as anything Beats put out in 2011 (and from what I read, remains bass heavy in the present). These aren’t studio monitors or reference headphones or audiophile headphones. They’re meant to just make your music sound good with little fuss, with the ability to tune to your liking. If you want audiophile headphones, neither Bose nor Sony nor Beats offerings in this segment meet that criteria. If you want bass heavy headphones, Bose, Sony, JBL have extensive options in that regards at several price points. As already stated, this meets the middle ground between neutral and bass emphasized. It’s warm out of the box, but not at the detriment of the rest of the range. Everything from low to high is clear and crisp. Nothing is overly harsh.Build quality is a little bit of a concern of mine. It’s very hard to find a set of headphones not made entirely out of plastic and no exception here. The inherent design of my OG Beats, though also loaded with plastic, felt sturdier, but the only moving points on those were the hinges, and to a far lesser degree, the cups moved on slight swivels to lay flat on your head. So it makes sense that they’d feel sturdy when there wasn’t a lot of pivot and rotation points. On these, the headphones have folding and rotating ear cups, and at all points across the build, there feels like there’s flex in it. I worry very much that my toddler or baby would get a hold of them and twist them to pieces. I don’t have that concern with either my Audio-Technica headphones, also mostly plastic, nor the Corsair gaming headset my toddler uses for his drum kit, which gets tossed around, stepped on, kicked around, and keeps on going just fine. But, as previously stated, the material choice keeps weight down, which keeps comfort high, like my Barracuda X. Both have lots of lightweight plastic. Both need to be kept away from kids that don’t know how to treat things with delicate touch. Though I know people do go for a run or workout with these, I wouldn’t recommend it. I don’t know if they’d survive a fall, and they’re not IPX rated anyhow against sweat or other moisture. Seriously, get some IPX rated headphones or use some earbuds for sweaty, motion filled sessions. Keep these for the office, study, travel, and everyday listening. With that said, these still feel like a premium product. They don’t feel cheap. I’m just leveling with anyone that is considering these of what their limitations may be.Feature set for these is quite extensive, and y’all can do your research on every last bit. Will just point out some things I was curious about when I purchased these.- The ANC has two presets: Quiet and Aware. You can craft your own presets in the app, and adjust them based on your liking and whether or not you think you’ll encounter wind. So far I find these basically pointless. I don't need to fine tune how much ANC I have. I either want to hear things, or don't.- The app also supports any firmware updates and allows you to tune your EQ to your liking. I can’t stand that there’s multiple Bose apps. I use one for these headphones and one for my Soundlink Flex. I really wish Bose would consolidate all their consumer, portable audio (meaning headphones, earbuds, and travel speakers) into one app. I don’t know why I need two apps for devices that both come and go with me. I’d be more forgiving of multiple apps along portable products versus home products (such as in-wall speakers and home theater speakers). It's especially confusing when the Soundlink Flex MAX is in the Bose Music app with the QuietComforts, but the Soundlink Flex is not. So weird, so pointless. Anyhow, I digress.- Like all QC lineups, these headphones also support analog playback over a traditional cable. They also all feature an asymmetric plug arrangement, 2.5mm on one end and 3.5mm on the other. Unlike the more expensive QuietComfort Ultras, this pair of headphones I’m reviewing allows for passive playback. If you run out of charge or are preserving charge, you can still use these without ANC and listen over the cable. And it has in-line mic as well. This gives you far more flexibility than the Ultras, and allows these headphones to serve double duty as an in-a-pinch gaming headset for an Xbox controller, and to continue to support phone calls, etc. through the in-line microphone even if you cannot or choose not to power them on. I cannot believe that Bose’s flagship product, the Ultras, do not offer that same versatility. This product would be even better if you could use these speakers powered but without ANC features (quiet or aware) enabled to conserve battery power, but retain the convenience of wireless.- Driver size is 35mm to the Ultras 40mm. My ATH-M50x, aptly named, are closer to 50mm drivers, and I believe the Barracuda X are 40mm or so. But the playback volume on the Bose seems louder and, obviously is more versatile than my analog only ATH-M50x comparison. The Barracuda, also wireless, are still less versatile in that they require the USB-C dongle or the analog cable to function, and lack ANC. Bluetooth 5+ is just far more versatile, even if it has latency that the aforementioned devices do not.- Main differences between these and the Ultras include the driver size (Ultra is larger), the amount of microphones used for ANC (the Ultra has more), the inclusion of Immersive Audio on the Ultras (like Spatial Audio on Apple… I’m honestly not sold by that at this time), battery life (these are longer than the Ultra), and the physical structure of them differ. These are just another rehash of the QC35, QC45 design, the Ultras are unique in their structure.They arrived at 60% charge and I listened to them for about 30 minutes before placing them on a USB-C charger. Within an hour I was at 100%. Could’ve been quicker. Idk. Was in the backyard playing with the kiddos and listening to the Bose Soundlink Flex (go buy one of those, I’d recommend that to anybody).So, who are these headphones for? A lot of people, but let’s face it, $349.99 will price out a lot of buyers. I’d recommend my existing ATH-M50x to people that want to spend under $200 and only care about reliable sound. I’d recommend Sony ULT ANC Headphones for people with $200 to spend that want ANC and plan on listening to Pop, Hip-Hop, EDM (their ANC is nearly as good as XM5, Sony’s competitor to these Bose… but they’re very bass heavy). I’d recommend Audio-Technica again to people with a budget of $100.These are a luxury product. I’m aware that there are headphones far more expensive than these. But these are still expensive to many people. At this price point, I’d expect no less than 5 years of usage, and as I’ve already stated, I’ve used $150 headphones for 7 years now. So with that said, a couple of points of advice to someone weighing investing into these:- These go on sale periodically down to $249.99. At that price, they’re still premium, but far more competitive against the likes of Sony XM5 and Apple AirPods Max.- Bose Refurbished is a great option. The warranty is exactly the same as the brand new product, and you save money. I’ve done just that with my Soundlink Flex and have been so happy. I’m doing it again with the QuietComfort Ultras, which I snagged at $259.99, instead of their new list price of $429.99.Okay, enough money talk. Back to who these are for. If you made it this far, the $249.99-$349.99 is obviously something you’re considering as a fair value.So with that said, if you are a professional or student that wants to block out the noise around you for hours on end so you can work, these are for you.If you use public transport and want headphones to help you escape the noise, these are for you. Just, uh, be aware of your surroundings. Ya know, be safe. Yadda yadda.If you want legendary ANC, comfort, sound quality as you go through the airport and on your plane, these are for you.If you want some good headphones for the gym, I’d say you won’t be disappointed, but I’d encourage you to do some research for other headphones before you make a plan to routinely sweat into or potentially toss about headphones that are not made for either.If you’re the type of parent that wants to spoil your kid with great headphones, I’d say keep looking unless you find your child as responsible and respectful as a grown adult. I would certainly have broken these as a kid, and maybe even as a teen out of negligence (i.e. tossing my loaded backpack around or something and accidentally smashing something inside or nearby, hard case or not). There are many great headphones out there for less money, and some that are more sturdy. If you want to bless your child that way, do some serious research first, amongst serious review websites that breakdown sound quality, build quality, etc.Wow, look at you! You made it through my Amazon novel! I mean review. Yeah, that's what I meant. Hope it gave you some things to think about as you find the perfect headphones for you. That Cypress Green sure looks good though, right?

For context, I have tried out about 5 different pairs in the last 6 years, starting with some Plantronics PRO's back in 2017, which i still use occasionally for travel.  Then I moved to some Sony ones which I did not like.  All of these other headphones were wireless and noise cancelling in the $100 to $150 range.  They each had some shortfall that made them hard to use.  Honestly out of all my previous headphoen the Plantronics were the best in quality and durability and Battery life.  Sony always had connectivity issues and would crash randomly.  Even the mid range model  WHCH710N which had a lot of issues.  They would randomly crash during zoom calls or listening to music.  Happened about 3-4 times a week, it was getting really annoying.I decided to tier up my headphones because I use them for work daily.  I thought it was a worth while investment.  I decided to go with Bose because of the name recognition and because I have seen many of my peers use them (Im a Software Engineer).My first impressions of the Bose headphones were :- Light- Easy to setup - reliable bluetooth connection (something Sony was lacking)- Excellent sound quality (Best sound quality - on par and slightly better than my Plantronics)- Comfortable (The most comfortable out of all the other headphones I've used)To elaborate further.  A common pain point I've experienced is difficulty pairing and dealing with unstable bluetooth connections with my other headphones.  I rightfully assumed that this was a price point issue, because I have not had that problem with the Bose headphones.  The Bose headphones were easy to setup, they also have apps to help with it.  But you can use them without any apps.They are very comfortable and fairly light, comparing to others i've used.  I sometimes wear these for 6-10 hours a day and I never have that weird ear pain that you can develop from wearing headphones for long.  I have very big ears so that is saying something.Sound quality is excellent.  Deep bass with excellent sound range, very satisfying to listen to.  They also have a great volume range.  This is what Bose is known for so they definitely get this right.CON 1:They do feel rather flimsy.  For this price point I expected more metal parts.  The materials look well made and have excellent form factor.  The headphones however are completely plastic from what I can tell.  I feel like one good tug would snap the hinges on the ear pieces.  This is a serious concern when you're wearing lose clothing or a hoodie.  The headphone could get caught in the folds of your clothing and if were to pull hard or fast while going through the motions you might break them.  I have no data to back this up obviously because I am not going to throw away perfectly good headphones to test that theory but you can sort of tell by holding them and pulling on them a little.CON 2:Battery life isn't great.  If I forget to turn them off at the end of my work day they somehow continue to deplete the battery.  The following morning they are already at 50% battery.  So that is 50% a day with only 6-8 hours of actual work (active use).  For reference, my old Plantronics headphones last for several days without needing a recharge.  I have gone on to use them for 5+ days without having to charge them.  Even the mid-range Sony headphones perform ""slightly"" better than this.  I know it's good practice to turn them off after you're done but one forgets to do that far more often than one would think.  There is room for improvement here.Overall i'd say these are excellent headphones with great sound quality and form factor.  Do take a little extra care because they are not the most durable headphones out there.  I am happy with. mySummary:PROS:  Sound Quality, Comfort, Weight, Form Factor, Easy Setup, Reliable Bluetooth ConnectionCONS: Battery Life, Durability",https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth/product-reviews/B0CCZC9J1V/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1

What I mean by that, is my boyfriend mixes music, and while these are high quality this review isn’t for those types of people. This is for more layperson type of needs.1. I actually used chat gpt to compare and contrast numerous headphones based on my desires so if you’re needing help choosing that was very helpful to me.2. My needs were as follows: light, comfortable, noise cancelling, color, Bluetooth across devices, and ease of app use.3. I discovered that these headphones outdo their Sony competition specifically because they’re lighter and they don’t drop Bluetooth when you move to your computer from your phone for example. I found Sony has issues trying to switch back to your phone when on computer.Bluetooth is very important to me and a top need. I switch between devices enough for that to be a serious issue for me.4. I have a tiny head and am a 5’2 woman. I don’t have large proportions. For example my boyfriend is 6 foot with a large head and headphone weight won’t affect him the same way. For me headphones can literally be too heavy and fatiguing so my other main qualifier was that these are lighter than all but 1 of the top 7 brands out there.5. The cushion on these is shockingly luxurious and an added bonus.6. I get a mean case of sensitive ears, I always have. When I run my ears ache, in the cold my ears ache, if I am in a plane they ache. I am part of a certain population percentage (I’ve googled it’s around 30% but fact check me- this is for you though if you are like me) who have ear canals that actually can be very painful with the wrong pressure. For this reason I’m fairly picky about headphones which apply a significant amount of pressure. These headphones have not triggered this issue for me.7. I wanted good plane headphones and these will be great if I lean my head on the window area. The band doesn’t dig.8. They look really nice.9. The color options are cute10. The case is nice11. I heard for Sony there was popping on phone calls and it therefore became between these and Apple however apples are very very heavy. I ended up going with these for that reason. I have used them for numerous phone calls and haven’t had the issues, and people hear me easily and have had no issues hearing me. I did have popping once but I think it’s on the end of the person you’re on the phone with. My cousin was in his car shouting into his Bluetooth and I feel if he had been quieter it wouldn’t have happened. The popping has never occurred with music and is specific to a loud shout from someone on their own CarPlay so no biggie. Otherwise zero pop12. The noise cancelling is exceptional, I put them on and don’t play anything, but can no longer hear my AC at all. You understand generally the sound of constant AC. Like vrrrrrrrrr. It’s completely gone.13. Soothing without music to just make things less loud. Suitable for autistics who want a quieting incognito headphone that changes, also more comfy than alternative ear covers. (I am AuDHD.)14. Music can get really loud and nice lots of depth (layerperson opinion but my boyfriend said the sound quality is great and the next step up is just studio mixing headphones)15. If you wait for prime day or other sales they’re 150$ off usually (better than every other competitors prime or Black Friday deals)16. They seem durable and collapse in many ways so you can’t easily break them.17. The app has had no issues for me. Online there’s some app complaints and I have not run into them at all.

My checklist includes very basic things like price, wireless capability, noise cancellation,  cannot fall off my head, decent charge time.1.Price:  I got these on prime day deal for almost half the price which mainly made me buy them.2.Wireless capability: I think bluetooth is very powerful. I kept my phone in my room and went in the kitchen and it doesnt disconnect easily.3. I think they are decent in blocking the external noises ( havent tried them on a teams call yet)4. Comfort: they do stay on the ears without any discomfort and are lightweight which is a plus for me. I feel like it wont hurt if i wear them all the time. And perfect for workouts and running5. Chargetime: they lack a bit in this area  having only 24 hours with a full charge. Other brnds perform much better in this area with 30-50 hours of play time with a full charge. However it is stated that with 15 minutes of charging a play time of 2.5 hrs can be achieved with these headphones which is good enough for a quick run/ excercise session for me( if the claim is true) .Bonus:1.

Unknown,RTOEPK2F01IIV,Positive,"Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth Headphones, Wireless Headphones, Over Ear Noise Cancelling Headphones with Mic, Up To 24 Hours of Battery Life, White Smoke",4.6,4.0,"5,603","There's just something about Bose quality and design. These headphones are perfect if you're looking for good sound quality, excellent noise cancelling, and--maybe most importantly for me--comfort. I don't know how they did it, but these really are crazy comfy to wear. They have a snug fit to boost sound quality and noise blocking, but they aren't tight at all and have a very nice, cushiony feel. I inevitably get headaches from wearing any other over-ear headphones for very long, but I've gone hours with these on my head and almost forgotten they're even there. I also like that they're not super-duper big and ostentatious. I'm not looking to wear these as a loud fashion statement and I like how sleek they are as-is. And I love the way they fold up to fit in their nice little case. It's the least awkward folding-of-headphones I've seen so far.I'm not an aficionado when it comes to sound quality, but I can tell you from personal experience and preference that the quality on these is great. Not the best out there, since, hey, you're not paying $600+ for these, but excellent nonetheless for me. You do have to have the volume up a bit to get the really epic listening experience, but that's no different from other over-ear headphones I've owned. The connected app is a no-frills affair that lets you adjust the sound a bit to your liking, and you can create additional listening modes with your preferred EQ, but I've been happy with the as-is modes already programmed into it. Set up with the app was blessedly uneventful. It connected on the first try and I've never had a bit of trouble connected new devices to my headphones. Glorious.Let's talk noise-cancelling. When that switch is flipped, the world outside your headphones is gone. It doesn't feel unnatural like you're sitting in a vacuum, but it does let you happily escape all the noisy distractions around you and just enjoy whatever you're listening to at whatever volume you prefer. I have to formally announce to anyone else home that I'm putting my headphones on because, aside from physically touching me or doing some acrobatics in my direct line of sight, I can't hear them at all if they're trying to get my attention--which, obviously, I love. Kind of the point of noise cancelling, right?The design of the headphones is simple and to the point in terms of controls. The last two pair of headphones I owned before these had awkwardly placed buttons for volume and pausing. I would always fumble to find them even after owning them for years. The controls on these Bose headphones are somehow placed just perfectly, and my fingers land on them on the first try every time. It's a little thing since a lot of us use our phones or smart watches to change the song and what not, but when I really am immersed and want to leave all distractions aside, using the controls on the headphones is a nice little treat, and that lack of fumbling to find them goes a long way to allowing me to stay in that happy and calm little headspace.I want to give these five stars for the price I paid (which, btw, was a sale price of 249.99 USD), but there's a couple of small, intertwined drawbacks for me that puts them at between a 4 and 4.5: the battery life and the power toggle/slider. The battery life is, in a word, fine. My previous headphones went for weeks of sporadic, casual listening without me needing to charge them, but they weren't as fancy and they weren't noise-cancelling. These Bose headphones need fairly regular charging, which isn't the end of the world, especially since--I assume--they use up more battery thanks to the awesomely effective noise-cancelling. It will last a long airplane trip but you'll need to charge it pretty soon after that or else you're going to be sans-headphones for at least part of the flight home.Then there's the power toggle. In general, I love this little toggle/slider. It's nothing but a tiny, silly, minor inconvenience, but I'm not a fan of the hold-this-for-a-little-while power buttons that also double as the button you need to activate Bluetooth/Bluetooth pairing. I always feel like an idiot when it's time to pair a new device to it and I can't figure out if I need to triple press the power button or what. A nice, small and easily accessible toggle/slider to turn the headphones on and off? Fantastic.The downside? You sure as heck better remember to turn the headphones off when you're not using them or they're going to remain on until the battery dies. In my experience, with that all-powerful toggle there is no automatic powering off if you leave the headphones out of use for an extended period of time. It will just drain that battery until the headphones are dead. It's a simple solution--just remember to scoot that slider to off when you're done with them! But, lamentably, I'm super forgetful and easily distracted, and some of you might be the same. I've now accidentally left my headphones on three times, and even though it is my fault, I've been pretty bummed that my headphones are totally dead when I pull them out again after that moment of forgetfulness. The automatic powering off after inactivity in my previous headphones is the one feature that I really, really miss. Is this a dealbreaker? Would I go back to those headphones because of this? Absolutely not. But from one concerned, forgetful listener to another, just remember to manually power down, even if you think you're only going to be stepping away from your headphones for two seconds :)Would I buy these again? In a heartbeat, but I probably won't need to. I've had them for seven months now but, if they're anything like the Bose speakers I've owned, they're going to last me a lot longer yet. Would I pay the full 350 USD price for them? Maybe. I got mine on sale, and they were even cheaper during Prime Day 2024. They're an awesome set of headphones, but if the price is still a little steep for you, maybe add them to your list and keep an eye on it. Bose products tend to go on sale periodically for much better discounts than, say, Apple products, especially around the holiday season.",https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth/product-reviews/B0CCZC9J1V/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1
Unknown,RUR84RZ9061M0,Positive,"Bose QuietComfort Bluetooth Headphones, Wireless Headphones, Over Ear Noise Cancelling Headphones with Mic, Up To 24 Hours of Battery Life, White Smoke",4.6,5.0,"5,603","I’ve owned & extensively used the Beats Solo Pros & Air Pods Pros.  I gave the Beats to my daughter as the ‘on-the-ear’ design was causing me pain on flights.  I migrated to the AirPods Pros hoping I’d get similar performance to the Beats with more comfort and less bulk on flights.  Ultimately, the Air Pods Pros just won’t stay in my ears and the ANC just isn’t as effective due to the lack of ear covers or better plugs.  So recently I ordered the new Bose QuietComforts and the 1More Sonoflows to compare.  I was hopeful on the 1More product due to being on sale for $67 and that the price savings would outweigh any deficits.  But ultimately I am going with the Bose QCs.  This is my personal opinion and what works best for me.  Keep in mind I have not extensively tested the Bose or 1More yet, but spent a day alternating between the two so this is based on initial impressions.  Categories are in personal order of importance.COMFORT/DESIGN:  I gave up the Beats due to pain/pressure from prolonged use of the on the ear cups.  I am also not a fan of the Air Pods Pro design, nor getting them to fit in my ears well and stay (I love the original air pods, and I’ve tried multiple buds for the Pros).  I have a large head so the Beats had to be fully extended to be on my head properly which probably increased pressure.  They fit my adult daughter much better.  The Bose QCs don’t require full extension on me, completely cover my ears, and the cups are really soft.  The 1More product covers completely, and is comfortable, but heavier & puts more pressure around my ears than the Bose, so I’m skeptical if I’d want to wear them more than an hour or so.  The pressure is a drawback especially given the ANC performance noted next.RANKING: Bose QC > 1More Sonoflow > Beats SoloPro > Air Pods ProANC:  In my immediate comparison of the Bose QCs and the 1More Sonoflow, there was a large difference in noise cancellation.  I use an infrared heater in my office sometimes that is pretty noisy.  Comparable to airplane noise but quieter.  The Bose is very effective against it despite fitting looser than the 1More product.  But the Bose has less options than the Beats for ANC modes and I found the Beats to be slightly better at full ANC than the Bose and quicker to switch modes.  The Air Pods are at a disadvantage here being an earbud product but they are effective and travel light.  The 1More product was the worst performer on ANC for me.RANKING: Beats Solo Pro > Bose QuietComfort > Air Pods Pro > 1More Sonoflow.SOUND/EQ/APP:  I always found the Beats Solo Pros to be balanced, clear, dynamic and pleasant.  Integrated with Apple, they worked great though many audiophiles will complain about the lack of EQ adjustments.  I liked the simplicity of them and not having to have an additional app.  Same goes for the Air Pods.  The Bose Sound is very good, as you would expect from Bose, and their App is simple and ok.  Out of the box very good and you can tune them to preference.  The 1More Product out of the box is definitely at the bottom of the pile.  It had an almost metallic, chunky, machine sound to me.  You can adjust them, update firmware, and tune them with the app which made the largest difference in the performance compared to the others.  The app did have a neat white noise feature with some different options.  It also had twice as many EQ adjustments points over the Bose.  Ultimately, I enjoy the Bose sound the most followed by the Beats and AirPods and then the 1More, but once tuned all are very good, especially if ANC with music or video on an airplane are your target use.RANKING:  Bose QC > Beats Solo Pro > Air Pods Pro > 1More Sonoflow.PHYSICAL FUNCTIONALITY:  For me, I love the Beats functionality.  Buttons are intuitive and easy to use, typical tactile Apple design.  AirPods are similar.  So far the Bose is ok, it’s intuitive and the buttons seem like they will be easy to learn.  The 1More Sonoflow is last here.  All buttons on the right side, the power button in front doubles as a function button and for me it’s awkward trying to find it on the front.  The 1More is last by a bit for me here.RANKING: Beats Solo Pro > Air Pods Pro > Bose QC > 1More SonoflowCASE:  Beats Case is cheap and not protective at all.  AirPods are AirPods.  The 1More Case fits but is a bit bulky, rounded, and the included accessory net is too small.  The Bose Case is well made, stiff, protective, has a large accessory net, and is rectangular shaped.  Personally I see it fitting in a carry on laptop bag or backpack much easier.RANKING:  Bose QC > 1More Sonoflow > AirPods Pro > Beats Solo ProBATTERY LIFE:  This is of limited importance to me.  But it seems to get tons of mention in every online review you read.  The headphones all have insanely long run times compared to older devices.  I always charge before a trip and never seem to end up with dead devices.  Charge your stuff.  Not that hard.",https://www.amazon.com/Bose-QuietComfort-Cancelling-Headphones-Bluetooth/product-reviews/B0CCZC9J1V/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1

Worked as advertised, auto-connects on engine start, and the connection stays resilient and hard to break. Although initially the night mode didn't work and I had to find a workaround.

Great option especially for those cars that have difficult to change stereos such as the Ford Taurus 2000-2007. This was put into a 2003 Hyundai Santa Fe. I don’t have an aux port or Bluetooth so I was stuck using the FM Transmitter. Not all that great in my vehicle. The FM antenna on my SUV is integrated into one of the rear windows. So its reception isn’t great.  Truth be told though, this connects QUICK! And its sound quality is great!If you have an aux port or Bluetooth already in your car and you don’t wanna cut up the dash? This is a great option! Admittedly, I wanted it in my dash. So I chose to bite the bullet and just install an inexpensive stereo that I put in for the convenience. And I don’t have a ton of dash space, so this was the better long term solution for me.",https://www.amazon.com/Portable-Wireless-Receivers-Bluetooth-Navigation/product-reviews/B0CPJ8715P/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1

I have several of these, and they seemed to work well (but admittedly I did not do any before / after testing to verify this. I just never noticed any issues with the filters.)That said, I bought this filter because it is a UV filter and I needed to filter out UV from my images. As I said, I already own two of these, so I should have tested them before buying this filter, and in fact, I never even opened the package. After placing the order, I realized that I owned it already (for a different lens size) and tested it with a 365nm UV light. The filter did not noticeably stop any of the UV. Subsequently, I looked at the Breakthrough Photography website, and they show a transmission graph for this filter. I suppose they thought that it showed how the filter cut out UV, but the transmission graph only showed what the filter did with visible light. I was later sent a transmission graph for both this filter (X2) and the more expensive X4. Neither one filters any UV light at all. In my opinion, they aren't a lot better than the atmosphere, eventually cutting out short wave UV. That isn't saying much. You have to buy special quartz glass to not filter out short wave UV.The people at Breakthrough Photography did not seem to understand or care about my problem. They told me that this is a photographic filter, not a piece of scientific equipment. Nevertheless, I am a photographer and I have a problem with UV light getting into my camera, causing the camera to see things that are not visible to the naked eye. Sure, I was using UV light to cause fluorescence, and I was taking a picture of the fluorescence. That isn't particularly scientific. Regardless of whether I am correct or they are, they should not sell a UV Filter that does not filter UV.  Sadly, they are not unique in this matter. It appears that many, but not all, of the other UV filters from other manufacturers have the same problem.

The filter threads onto my lenses without any hesitation or grinding.  The lens cap secures to the filter as well as it does to the lens.  The low profile design ensures that the filter doesn't create any vignetting or otherwise alter the lens field of view.  From the very unscientific tests that I tried, the filter's anti-reflective coatings appear to be effective as I was not able to detect any noticeable flare or ghosting with very bright objects in the field of view.My nitpicks are actually not with the filter itself.  The retail packaging wouldn't qualify for Amazon's frustration-free packaging designation.  Despite the fancy carton, the PITA factor of getting it to separate was significant enough that I'm calling it out  (hint: add a couple semicircle finger cut-outs to make the two halves easier to separate).  Fortunately, inside was a reusable storage case, making this ""frustration"" a one-time deal.  The complementary lens cloth was a thoughtful addition, unfortunately mine was contaminated with paper fibers from the retail box, making me question whether I should even consider using it.

Picture quality is a lot better than expected.The unit itself hangs from your windscreen, and the mounting they give you allows no articulation. So it's either mounted centered behind the rearview mirror(which defeats the purpose of the rear view camera because you can't see the screen), or it's blocking some of your windscreen/mounted off kilter and hard to use because it's mount won't allow you to freely adjust its position. I could've got around this problem by rerouting the rear view camera to my head unit, but the plug on the rear camera doesn't plug in, and there is no adapter available.I've decided this is a temporary rig until I get a more ergonomic one, but it does work for now.

First initial thoughts are decent. I have not powered it up yet and have just today mounted it the way that I wanted (I am picky about how I planned the setup). My 2018 Tacoma comes with a gopro mount already installed in the top center passenger side (pics to come) I was hesitant about buying this camera because of the lack of detail on the mounting point, there was only pictures of the flat adapter for the adhesive pad. I included photos that will hopefully help some of you that are as confused as I was about the mounting adapters. I was successful in using a rotary tool to chew thru the mount for the suction cup and convert it to the gopro ecosystem of mounts. It's not exactly pretty but I do not own a 3D printer, nor do I have the time to fabricate one. A little work with the rotary tool however was enough to get it to mount with the additional purchase of the gopro adapters (will link in the future as well).*UPDATE 2*Hardwire instillation was not exactly easy, but not impossible. Make sure you set aside about 1 to 2 hours for proper wiring. The product states that you can only use up to a 256GB memory card... well I had a 512GB samsung card and it works just fine... atleast 488GB of it (picture attached of unit display).Initial reactions of the camera is very good, I still would rate it a solid 5 star camera for the price. I highly recommend getting the hardwire/park detection kit. It is only an extra wire to run and a small sensor to place. Make sure you look up how to properally install it to your specific vehicle if you are going to DIY. Night cameras are very excellent and you can get a wide field of view with the cameras. I would say the rear camera is a little less responsive than those of the main unit. I had to purchase the bracket that the other reviewer left, but it was well worth it. I would advise purchasing some film to help prevent reflection at night with the IR lights. I will probably do one more review for this dash came after I've ran with it for about 3 months.",https://www.amazon.com/PRUVEEO-Channel-Camera-1080Px4-D90-4CH/product-reviews/B0BJZQ37G7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1

This thin works great, and I really like the fact all of the cameras are very adjustable and have great looking video. I also like that you can view the videos showing your location, speed, etc. using their app you can download for free. All views are recorded and you can view each one as a separate video. It's a very easy setup, plug and play basically once you get everything mounted and wires hidden. I gave it 4 stars only because this thing is big and takes up more room than most dash cams but this is mainly due to the larger screen size, which I prefer so it's not a deal breaker to me. Also, I am VERY skeptical of anything which uses a suction cup mounting. My personal experience has been, they just do not hold up like a solid, mechanical mount. This one has TWO mounting options, the other being a plastic mount with very sticky tape which sticks to the surface and the camera clicks in some slots in the mount. This was the option I ended up using because I tried the suction cup and, you guessed it, 10 minutes after mounting the camera it was laying on the dash! Now granted, it was very hot that day so that's probably why it didn't hold any longer than it did. I did hook up the rear camera although I do not use it as a backup camera. It has plenty of wire to mount it virtually anywhere you need it and you can hook it up to your reverse lights and use it as a backup camera if you do not have that function in your car. Overall, this is a good dash cam, I'm happy with it and would recommend it to anyone who wants a reasonably priced camera with a lot of options and quality video recording.Update: Unfortunately, you cannot change the time format from 24 hr to 12 hr.

Why?  If you want a tablet simply to watch videos, shop on Amazon, read Kindle books, play a few games and use a few apps, there's probably no better deal than the Max, and the S9 is both way more expensive and complicated to set up than the Fire (unless you've got a Samsung smartphone.) But I am tired of needing to boot the Max 2 or 3 times in a row before it truly works. I'm tired of the Max hanging and kicking me out of apps. Now, I have a lot of apps and do a lot of multitasking so I've probably simply outgrown Amazon. I  hope this helps with your decision-making.9/25/2023:TL;DR - By the start of this month, I had had it with this tablet. When it worked, it was fine. But it froze constantly, kicked me out of apps, took up to 2 minutes to reboot, sometimes required two reboots in succession to work properly. But on Sept. 16, the OS was updated to version 8.3.2.0. In the past two weeks, most of the problems have disappeared. There are still occasional glitches, but recovery is quick.I'm hoping this won't change, but will update this review if it does.N.B. This is my 8th Fire Tablet, starting with the original. My current tablet is the HD10 (2021)N.B. The restore problem has more or less (maybe less) been fixed (see below), so I've upgraded my review to 3 stars.July 3, 2023 Update to Performance section.What kind of buyers should look at this tablet?Apple users? You're kidding, right? Of course not.Android users who want a  less expensive tablet? Not unless they're willing to accept a stripped down, less functional interface. Skins for Android are usually designed to enhance the experience. Amazon, on the other hand, removes functionality and is based on Android11which is, per The Verge, nearly 3 generations out of  date. I don't know if this is by design, contracts with Google or what. But Amazon clearly has no interest in competing in the wider Android market and doesn't mind shortchanging its own customers.The Amazon ecosystem? Yes. If, like me, you have hitched your pony to Amazon Prime and Kindle, yes, then take a look because it does appear to be the best Fire tablet yet. I ordered it because my 2021 HD10 has slowed to the point where molasses moves faster. I am hoping I can get this Fire to work without spending hours and hours and hours to reconstruct my environment. N.B. As an original Fire owner, I own a lot of apps and games I would have to buy if I bought a non-Amazon tablet.If you already own a Fire tablet, most of the things I dislike about the Fire tablets in general do not appear to have not changed.Unboxing: Hands down this is the easiest unboxing of any Amazon device ever. You simply pull off a strip with arrows on it and pull out the Max11. The tablet boots up in landscape mode (which some professional reviewers have asserted is how the tablet is designed to be used) but then quickly reverts to portrait mode. N.B. I had to hold the power button (upper left) down for 3-5 seconds.Display: Amazon's ""latest & greatest"" has a screen resolution of  2000 X 1200. The 2013(!) HDX 8.9 had a screen resolution of 2460 x 1600. What was Amazon thinking? (It's not that the resolution isn't good, it is, but it could be better.)Form Factor: For me, the 8.9 inch HDX was the perfect size. Large enough to comfortably read a book or watch a video, small enough to fit in a courier bag. The 10-inch HD, which I've had for two years, is very uncomfortable to hold and will not fit into a courier pouch.  This tablet is, however, lightweight (without the cover and keyboard) and feels quite speedy. I've written a review about the bundle elsewhere.Folders: You still cannot create a folder on the Home screen, then click to see a list of apps and add them in. Every inexpensive Android smartphone has had this functionality for years. I assume every one of Amazon's programmers has such a phone. Why Amazon can't add this simple feature is beyond me. Also, you still cannot sort the apps in a folder.Keyboard: You  apparently cannot use the on-display keyboard if the physical keyboard is attached. I think I understand the logic, and  it is easy to attach/detach the keyboard  with Amazon's bundle, but I wonder how it will work with other physical keyboards.The recharger: It ships with a 9W charger. Why oh why oh why. You'll need to buy the 15W recharger yourself. Don't bother unless recharge time is very important to you.Performance: This tablet is quite zippy. I was able to move between Silk, email, Kindle and Twitter quickly and easily. I didn't do any benchmarks, but performance seemed almost as good as my Galaxy S20+ or my XPS8700.  Except, well, sometimes it slows down to molasses - because, apparently, it can't handle background downloads.ALERT: If  the MAX starts to slow down or freeze a lot, check for downloads (app/game update, email, even notifications). Most Android devices can handle a 20 or 30 MB background download with no effect on performance. Not so the Max. Set your updates to Manual, and then update each app/game independently. {See top of review, TL;DR, for update on performance.)RESTORE PROBLEM:As I posted with my 2 star review, the restore from my HD10-2021 failed completely. None of my apps, folders, bookmarks or Silk history were restored.Unable to reach a person at Amazon, I finally simply restored the Max to factory defaults and set it up again. This time the restore did work, sort of.  It took almost 5 hours to get most everything. I got my Silk bookmarks back but not my Silk history. There are still a bunch of anomalies I am working through. If you're interested, I'll post all the gory details in Amazon's Digital and Device Forum (https://www.amazonforum.com/s/topic/0TO6Q000000QQOxWAO/fire-max-11) in the next day or two.Old Stuff: The Google Play StoreI can't confirm this is still true with the Max, but:1. No. Amazon still does not support the Google Play Store. I don't know why. I assume it makes too much money from its own inadequate play store?2. You can download and  install APKs from trusted sites and they will run, provided you allow the installation of external apps  (Apps  & Notifications/Special App access/Enable for Silk.) They will work provided they don't need access to Google Play Services.3. It has been possible to install the Google Play Store on most of the previous generations of the Fire, and I assume it can still be done. It involves downloading four apps in a particular sequence. The hows are available on the net.  It is possible that this may create a problem in the future, but, so far, most of those who go to the trouble of doing it don't regret it. So, if you are a techie and desperately want something that will only work with Google Play Services, it's worth a try. You can always uninstall the components later.",https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-powerful-display-octa-core-processor/product-reviews/B0B1VQ1ZQY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1

My favorite of them all is the Fire HD 8 (2020 version). Why? It's the most reliable of the bunch. I  do need to give some background and context. I don't live only in the Amazon ecosphere and rely on Google apps. This Fire Max is basically an Android table with Amazon's OS/UI sitting on top of it. If there were no side-load option to install the Google Play store, I would give up all Fire tablets. So, like I said, the Fire HD 8 version is the most reliable because it is stable. Apps don't close unexpectedly or slow down the whole tablet which happens often on the Fire Max 11. Ideally, I wanted to rely on this tablet for a lot of stuff when traveling and not bring a Chromebook, but I realize I can't depend on this. Last trip, I had to use my Android phone for most apps I expected to run on this tablet. The screen on the Fire Max 11 is great and when it works, I do enjoy it. It just doesn't work like I expected. Hate that I have to keep testing earlier versions of the Google Play store and associated files (if you have side-loaded the Google Play store, you know what I mean). If I wanted to spend that much time on IT admin, I would have stuck with a regular PC. No, thank you. So, if you only utilize apps that are in the Amazon ecosphere, this is a 5 star product, but if you are like me and rely on the broader array of apps in the Google Play Store, this is a solid 2 star tablet. Speed is the main thing going for it when it doesn't lock up.

Applications simply shut down, for no reason, without notice, after five to ten minutes of use (e.g., MS Word, YouTube, etc.).B. Doesn't remember  settings from one startup to the next.C.  In many soft or hard device re-starts, the Fire Max 11 tells me the Sandisk SD Card I added for extra storage is not recognized and has to be re-inserted.  A reboot causes this ""tablet"" to forget the problem.  The issue is not that I have to re-insert the Sandisk SD card.  The issue is that the Fire Max inconsistently does or does not recognize the Sandisk SD card.  Sandisk SD cards are high-quality storage devices.  I do not have this problem with Sandisk SD cards that I use in my Fujifilm cameras, audio devices, or other laptops.D. File Management utility has very poor functionality.  Intuitive right-click functionality is not available to move files around, copy/paste files.  Cannot rename files.E. Downloaded/installed Amazon's ""Notepad"" utility, which is a joke.F.  ""Silk"" Browser lacks important and useful functionality that can be found on ALL browser utilities for over twenty years (e.g., bookmark management, font size, available settings or setting retention, color choices, etc.)G.  Silk Browser offers ZERO options to adjust font size or Zoom the objects in the screen...features that ARE available in other browsers.  The ONLY option provided by Silk is the ""Pinch-Zoom"" which truncates all content on the right or left of the window in use.  Compare this with any browser on a laptop computer, where the +/- Zoom enables objects to be zoomed...but the content still remains INSIDE the physical screen of the laptop.H.  No good browsers are available to install on this Fire Max 11 tablet (e.g., Chrome, Edge, Firefox, etc.)  You are stuck with Silk as your only browser option.I.  Installed MS Word software functionality is incomplete, when compared with modern word processing tools.  But you cannot use the ""Wordperfect"" option that the Fire Max 11 repeatedly offers, because of errors on attempting the install.J.  Just saving a Word document of simple text is a struggle.  The ability to CTRL/A highlight the text in the file, to then set all the text to the same font type and size....is NOT A FUNCTION THAT IS AVAILABLE.K. Almost ZERO third-party software utilities exist to download and install on this ""tablet"".  Compare this with other brands of tablets where good third-party software is available.L.  Weird error messages pop-up in almost every session, about some already installed utility being too new or too old for the version of Android on the device.  What is causing all these weird, random, out of context error messages?M. In conclusion, I wasted $200 on this Amazon Fire Max 11 piece of junk. I will sell it for $50, just so I can stop looking at it.  Do not make my mistake.  Go check out Google or Microsoft or Apple tablets.  I love Amazon, but Amazon needs to leave tablet manufacturing to companies that have a history of tablet manufacturing.-------------------------------------------------------UPDATE:  AFTER ANOTHER MONTH OF USEA. Application shutdowns have become more frequent (e.g., YouTube just shutting off).B.  Application lock-ups have now started.  Previously, YouTube app would just shut off.  Now, it locks up while a video is playing.  No mouse clicks or keyboard clicks can get the screen to respond.  Only solution is the to do a ""hard reboot"" by press/hold the physical power button.C.  After YouTube lockup and ""hard reboot"", YouTube then FAILS to restart.  Clicking the YouTube icon activates YouTube as usual, and begins the ""increasing percentage"" display that occurs with each start up.  However, when activating YouTube after a ""hard reboot"", the ""percentage"" display never goes beyond 10%.  Instead, I am required to do a soft reboot or hard reboot of the device to get YouTube to start working again.CONCLUSION:  I consider this device to be pretty much unusable.  I purchased this device to check news during the workday, so that I would not use my employer laptop for personal stuff.SELL THE FIRE MAX?  I previously thought of selling this device.  But I now feel it would be unethical of me to sell a device to someone, knowing that the device is defective.  I will keep the device in hopes that I can use it as just a poorly functioning Kindle book reader.",https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-powerful-display-octa-core-processor/product-reviews/B0B1VQ1ZQY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1

You can read and compare the technical specifications for yourself. I'm coming from their previous ""flagship"" tablet, the Fire HD10 Plus. Here are some of my thoughts. It has a premium feel with its aluminium body, but it is also very slippery. The previous model was plastic, but it felt really good in the hand, and really didn't look bad at all. The screen seems to look a little nicer on this one, and the speakers seem to sound a bit better. My previous Fire came with a max 64 GB of memory, this one 128 GB. It does seem a bit faster, but it is also new and doesn't have a ton of stuff on it... yet. It comes designed with contacts built into the side to fit in its own special keyboard, which I did not order. Side-by-side next to the old model in portrait mode it is a bit taller. When held in landscape mode while playing games, it is very easy to accidentally touch the volume buttons. There is no headphone jack, but it connects flawlessly to my wireless headphones.It was easy enough to install the Google Play Store following online tutorials, but it seemed just a bit more glitchy downloading some software from the Play Store compared to the previous Fire tablets that I've owned in the past. I'm not sure why that happened, or if Amazon cares one way or the other about people side loading the Play Store on their tablets. But the day they prevent it will be the day I stop buying Fire tablets. And finally, I always buy either Fentie Honeycomb or Poetic Turtle silicone cases (with front-facing speaker ports) for my tablets. They redirect the sound towards the user, making it much louder and clearer. Unfortunately so far they don't appear to be available for this model tablet. Anyway, that's my experiences and thoughts. Your mileage may vary.EDITI've been putting this tablet through it's paces and one thing I can say is that compared to the numerous Fire tablets that I have owned in the past, I have never owned one that has been this glitchy in the software department. I'm not only having issues with some sideloaded software, but even Amazon's own Kindle reader software is acting up and not displaying the cover art on many of my downloaded books in grid display mode. I'm hoping a (near) future software update will fix these issues. I think the tablet itself is great, but glitchy software really puts a damper on the user experience.EDITWell, now whenever I restart the tablet it asks me how I plan to use my micro SD card. I don't know what's up with Amazon and their software, but this is getting to be a headache that I don't need. I'm seriously thinking about returning this thing.EDITOK, so all of my downloaded books completely disappeared. I'm in the process of downloading them again, and it appears that they are downloading property with the cover art displaying as it should. I'm going to go ahead and keep the tablet and hope for the best going forward. Maybe they just need time to work all of the bugs out, I don't know.",https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-powerful-display-octa-core-processor/product-reviews/B0B1VQ1ZQY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1

Had to once again restart & register the tablet because power ran out & after charging apps wouldn't load. Now I have to make sure that if it is getting close to being without power I need to plug it in before it dies & also no completely powering off the device ever if I want certain apps to keep working which means that battery will not last as long as it should because of that. super Frustrating & Annoying.Update; Amazon Customer service contacted me to see if we could work out the issues but, I didn't have the time that it might take to try to fix the issue at that moment so they said they would call me the next day. Needless to say I am still waiting to hear back from them. This was probably at least 2 weeks ago or more; shortly after I posted my original review.I really like this tablet (I had 2 fire tablets before this one & this is now my 3rd fire) I love the larger screen & the fingerprint ID. One of the big problems I am having is with the Hulu app & sometimes the Prime Video App. The Prime App i sometime have to restart my Fire Max 11 in order for it to open up; why you ask?, that I cannot answer but, the other HUGE issue is with the HULU app. It keeps crashing every time I turn off my Fire Tablet (power it down completely) & in order to get it to work again I have had to backup, reset my Fireback to factory setting & then restore. I don’t understand why this keeps happening but, I know I am not the only one that this keeps happening to. I also have the issue with my SD card store not being with recognized; as it it says that the device isn’t there, to reinsert it or that it is corrupted. This doesn’t happen all of the time but, sometimes. And, the SD CARD slot is a bear to open; that part was very poorly designed. When you push the little SD Card holder slot open with a pin or SD card key it barely opens & you have to fight with it to get the tray out so that you can load your card in.If all of these issues were fixed I would be giving it higher ratings. At the moment I am very frustrated with it. One of the reasons that I got it was so that I could download & watch movies & such on a trip but, when an app keeps crashing after shutting down a device that was impossible.",https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-powerful-display-octa-core-processor/product-reviews/B0B1VQ1ZQY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1

I spent 30 to 45 minutes looking through the app for this feature, to find nothing of course. What will go next? Why don't you take page turning away and just put us on a timer, we all should read at the same speed, don't you think?? Hahaha What other conveniences should go? I can't buy another Amazon device again because I know it will never stay the same long enough to enjoy it the way it was when you bought it and it is never for the better.~~~~Original review formerly in progress~~~~I bought this primarily for kindle books and I do even more reading on it than I ever thought I would so I'm very grateful for that and the battery has lated even longer than probably the specs say as well. I turn the display brightness down to about half and it makes the battery last longer and keeps my headaches away too.I find myself searching on every link I come across and listening to so much more music now. The bad thing is that I'm shopping more too. Haha I guess that's what we work for... and to keep Amazon in business.As I wrote earlier, even at about half brightness the display is very detailed and lively, I don't feel like I'm missing anything.The things I feel I'm missing that I'd pay a higher price for the pen if it would be included(I know it can be bundled), headphone jack/plug(I miss having the separation from USB and heaphone out and having another option from Bluetooth earphones), and bigger or louder speakers, richer more lush sound, maybe back to 4 channel. Oh and if it had Google appstore support completely, I have read some reviews and some say you can sideload it or something like that, but I did that with Blackberry, and no, it isn't an option I'm too old now if you had to ask.

It shows off media very well and is bright even when outside. It's also nice and big as well.*The speakers are fine (they won't be winning awards, but it's a tablet and does the job)*The processor is snappy, my wife hasn't run into any lag issues. It's fast and responsive.*MS Office (being able to use office suite is what sets this apart.) Works great with the keyboard you can buy.*If you buy the pen, it adds another layer of productivity to it.*The overall slim design. It doesn't feel cheap, or like a toy like older models which had those plastic backs.CONSKeyboard not included-I understand that no tablet really comes with one, but I feel it should. When you add the keyboard to this tablet, you really have the option of being very productive and utilizing MS office to its max.no pen included-seems like something that should be included, they aren't that expensive to add.Amazon App store-Why amazon still refuses to allow the google play store is beyond me. You are still locked into the Amazon app store. While most people won't have a problem with it (most of your content consumption apps are available) you will find yourself running into a few apps that you use on your google phones, that you won't be able to have on your tablet.Overall, nothing that I criticized about the tablet are deal breakers. Amazon runs specials that bundle keyboards and pens with the tablet all the time. Overall, this seems like the table that most people should buy, it's light, responsive and best of all, waaay cheaper than an ipad, and does most, but not all that an ipad can do.",https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-powerful-display-octa-core-processor/product-reviews/B0B1VQ1ZQY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1
Unknown,R2UVO7KRI8QBTY,Positive,"Amazon Fire Max 11 tablet (newest model) vivid 11” display, all-in-one for streaming, reading, and gaming, 14-hour battery life, optional stylus and keyboard, 64 GB, Gray",4.4,5.0,"10,135","Well, for $190-$230 this tablet might not be the best at one particular thing, but thanks to some common-sense decisions and Amazon's resources and commitment, it's competent enough at everything, all at once.Media consumption, retro games, word processing, digital art, battery life, you name it.For media consumers, it has an obscenely long battery life and a pretty nice screen. Contrast is surprisingly good for an IPS display (the black areas look black), colors are very poppy, and the 5:3 aspect ratio means you're not losing much space on either 16:9 or 4:3 content.For retro games, let's talk about the processor. It has a Mali G57 MC2, 2 Cortex A78 cores, and 6 Cortex A55 cores. Anyone who keeps up with Android hardware will know this is a bizarre setup. The Mali G57 MC2 and Cortex A55s are all modest, cheap, power-sipping technology. While the Cortex A78s are freakishly fast for this price point.But I'm certain Amazon did this on purpose, and it's responsible for the great battery life, which is essential for what is basically a media consumption tablet. The modest GPU and high number of ""little"" cores keep battery drain minimal (this is a 5w chip, in a tablet, where 7-10w chips are the norm) while 2 A78s give it some serious oomph for the right sorts of tasks.This accidentally makes this little tablet a retro gaming powerhouse, as that relies heavily on single-core performance, with the GPU and secondary cores being an afterthought.So, it's a tablet that just excels at anything where you'll be using the screen a lot. Reading, movies, old games, etc. It may struggle with native Android games due to the weaker GPU, but compared to retro games there aren't a lot of worthwhile Android games anyway IMO.The keyboard and stylus are also very well executed.I'm typing this review on the keyboard case, and the keys are a nice size thanks to the TKL form factor, with short travel and a nice tactile, springy feel. The trackpad is small, but accurate and doesn't ""lose"" my finger.The stylus itself uses a user-replaceable AAAA battery. I like this decision, because small Li-po batteries wear out fast, and the AAAA means that the stylus has a super long life without worrying about whether you'll be able to find a replacement in a few years. The stylus is also magnetic and clips to the side of the tablet.The stylus is pretty accurate. I don't notice much parallax or judder. My Galaxy Tab S8 actually had slightly more parallax. However, there is more input lag than you'll get with something like a Galaxy Tab S8 or iPad with Apple Pencil. It's a quite noticeable amount of input lag compared to those two. I will mention, this tablet is about 1/3 the price of those devices and actually has a longer battery life. So it's still better than you expect for the price. But will definitely be more of an ""entry level"" art tablet instead of something outstanding.All in all, I still think you're getting a lot more for your money with this tablet than the others available. Amazon's reach with e-readers, with keyboards, with stylus peripherals, with tablets, and their resources and supply chain (ie, being able to order unusual tablet SoCs) has definitely given the Kindle Fire 11 a wider spread of abilities and better quality than your ordinary budget tablet. I can't really name anything I'd expect to be better for the price.The only real flaw is software; since Google Play is not preloaded and Amazon is not putting a lot of effort into their own App store, be prepared to sideload some apps if you want to use the broader spectrum of abilities this tablet has.",https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-powerful-display-octa-core-processor/product-reviews/B0B1VQ1ZQY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1

To put into context my love of the Fire Tablet, I’ve owned (or bought and returned) the following over the past 11 years:Fire 7 (2012/2014/2020),Fire HDX 7 (2014),Fire HD 8 (2018),Fire HD 8+ (2020/2022),Fire HD 10 (2018, 2019),Fire HD 10+ (2021),Fire Max 11 (2023).Of those, the ones I kept or kept the longest was the Fire HDX 7, the Fire 7 (2014), and the Fire HD 10 (2018).Specs for the Fire Max 11 can be found within the product description.Design and BuildThe Max 11 boasts a sleek and modern design, coupled with a build quality that feels robust and premium. Its lightweight aluminum structure makes it convenient for both work and leisure, allowing easy handling and portability. I like that it went back to a similar size/ratio of the 2018 HD 10.PerformanceEquipped with a more powerful processor than its predecessor, the Max 11 is capable of handling various tasks smoothly. Whether I am browsing the web, watching videos, or using multiple apps simultaneously, the experience is fluid and lag-free, especially compared to my HD 10.While not ‘blazingly fast’, it IS much faster than I expected.  Out of curiousity, I wound up trying it with a bluetooth keyboard/mouse combo, and for the first time-I feel this is a possible viable laptop replacement for light to medium users.  My HD 10 does not make a viable laptop replacement.  Great multitasking ability, can run enough apps at once with little to no lag.The speakers are merely adequate, if not a tad disappointing.  Thought normally I either use ear buds or a bluetooth speaker.  I don't miss having a head phone jack, and love having the quite responsive finger print sensor on the power button.DisplayThis has been probably my biggest surprise.  The display is vibrant and crisp, offering excellent viewing angles. It renders colors accurately, making it a joy to use for both media consumption and reading.  I do wish it was a TAD brighter at times, but the vibrancy of the colors makes up for it most of the time.  I’d wondered how much of a viewing difference going from the 10 to the 11 would be, and it’s shockingly a pretty big difference.  The Max 11 almost feels like a small tv, or laptop screen at times.Battery LifeBattery life has been good.  It’s not the best nor the worst, and should be more than adequate for most users.  Since I have chargers adjacent to most places I use the tablet in my house, I’ve also not needed to run it low.ValueOne of the reasons I’ve had so many Fire tablets (I’ve owned only one other non Fire tablet, a 6th gen iPad mini that I use for my business) is that I love the value proposition and ease of use.  Reviewers like to talk down the Fire software, but I have never minded it.  I am admittedly deep into the Amazon ecosystem with movies, books, music, etc., so the operating system has always made it easy to access and use that stuff.  I have also side loaded the Play store (I did this on my HD 10 also), so I have access to almost the entire Play store of apps on my Max 11.  If one is really ambitious, you can essentially turn it into more an Android operating system.  Personally, I have never like the tablet OS offered from iPad or Android tablets.  When the Fire Max 11 was first announced, I was excited about the specs, but hesitant on the price.  So I waited until Prime Day to buy it, also taking advantage of the trade in offer.  In terms of what I paid ($229-$30 trade in gift card-$46 trade in 25% off-$80 prime day offer=$73.99), of course it’s an awesome value.  At $229…I would suggest either going refurbished if available or just waiting it out for the inevitable discounts (at the time I write this, it’s on sale for $189.99).  But I still think it’s a great tablet at $229, and wouldn’t fault anyone that pays that.OverallIn conclusion, the Fire Max 11 strikes a balance between aesthetics and functionality, offering a modern solution that should meet the needs of most while offering value and longevity. It might be a worthy addition to your tech arsenal, promising reliability and efficiency in daily use.Rating: 4.5/5",https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-powerful-display-octa-core-processor/product-reviews/B0B1VQ1ZQY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1

We use the 8 and 10 inch sizes in industry because of value for the dollar and they have spectacular durability (even of they aren't the fastest on the market)I have used fire tablets every single generation since the first. They have NEVER disappointed me.I am running 3 fire tablets now, in addition to cell phone and laptop. An 8 a 10 and this 11.I use the 8 for reading books and surfing while traveling or at work, and the 10 for when I am at home.This model may be a bit too large for many purposes. It works superbly, but it is inconvenient to hold as a tablet. I finally decided to buy the keyboard cover and use the 11 inch as a fake laptop for when I am being a road warrior and need something lighter and smaller than my full blown ""desktop replacement"" level laptop. for that purpose, i am very satisfied, but as a tablet only it was too cumbersome for my taste.I STRONGLY recommend ALL fire tablets for home and industrial use as the best bang for the buuckIt gets even better when they release a new model and you can trade your old one in to get the newer, better model, for only a few dollars after sale, trade in, and bonus percentage discount when you trade something in!!!!!On MOST electronic items I trade in every two years or two generations. With kindle fires, because of the deals we get for trading in, i replace every single generation",https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-powerful-display-octa-core-processor/product-reviews/B0B1VQ1ZQY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1

The 11-inch display is a standout feature, boasting a crisp 2000 x 1200 resolution. This provides clear and vibrant visuals, making it a pleasure to watch movies, browse photos, or read e-books. The screen's brightness and color accuracy are impressive, even in direct sunlight, which is ideal for outdoor use. The overall build quality of the tablet is robust, with a sleek aluminum body that feels premium and durable in hand, making it both aesthetically pleasing and sturdy for daily use.In terms of performance, the Fire Max 11 is powered by an octa-core processor and 4GB of RAM, which delivers smooth and responsive app performance. Navigating through the interface is generally fluid, and most apps load quickly without significant lag. This makes it suitable for a variety of tasks, from streaming HD video content to playing casual games. The battery life is another strong point, offering up to 12 hours of mixed-use on a single charge, ensuring that the tablet can easily last through a day of moderate to heavy use without needing a recharge.However, there are some limitations to consider. While the tablet handles most apps well, it struggles with more demanding applications and high-end games. There can be occasional slowdowns or stuttering when multitasking with several resource-intensive apps open at the same time. Additionally, the Amazon Fire OS, while user-friendly, is heavily integrated with Amazon services, which can feel restrictive for users who prefer a more traditional Android experience or access to the Google Play Store. Some popular apps may not be available, or may require sideloading, which could be a hassle for less tech-savvy users.Another area where the Fire Max 11 falls short is in its camera quality. The front and rear cameras are adequate for basic video calls and casual snapshots but do not deliver the high-quality images or video that more premium tablets offer. The lack of a fingerprint sensor or facial recognition for unlocking the device also feels like a missed opportunity, as these features have become standard in many modern tablets. This means relying on traditional PIN or password methods, which might be less convenient for some users. Additionally, while the tablet's build is generally solid, it is slightly heavier than some competitors, which could be a drawback for prolonged one-handed use.In conclusion, the Amazon Fire Max 11 tablet offers good value with its excellent display, solid build quality, and decent performance for everyday tasks. However, its limitations in handling more demanding applications, restricted app ecosystem, and mediocre camera quality might be points of consideration for potential buyers.",https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-powerful-display-octa-core-processor/product-reviews/B0B1VQ1ZQY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1
Unknown,R2ZN0SIEF94NLY,Positive,"Amazon Fire Max 11 tablet (newest model) vivid 11” display, all-in-one for streaming, reading, and gaming, 14-hour battery life, optional stylus and keyboard, 64 GB, Gray",4.4,5.0,"10,135","UPDATE: I've been using this Fire for about a year (got it on Prime Day 2023) and I still like it a lot. It is a bit heavy for relaxed reading, so I also got the Fire 10 HD (13th gen) this year, 2024 Prime Day. Indeed the 10 is significantly lighter even thought the size difference between the two is fairly small (same width but 11 is taller when in portrait, so it is wider screen in landscape). It is nice to have both. I will keep using the 11 with the keyboard it came bundled with and I will not get a keyboard for the 10. The keyboard is awesome and having the 11 be wider than the 10 allows the keyboard to be very comfortable. So if you touch-type, and want the attached keyboard, I recommend the 11 over the 10. I've used the keyboard extensively and it really is great (other than accidentally touching the touch pad occasionally, and unintentionally change my typing location).Also, I noticed that the 10 is annoyingly slower than the 11 when rendering all the icons on my home screen. Occasionally the icons disappear and you have to wait for them to reappear. It is only a couple of seconds but I don't recall ever seeing that on a ""regular android"" device, so it is a Fire OS issue that is more apparent with the slower 10. But the main reason I decided to write an update is the SD card issue that some other reviewers mentioned.I thought others had issues because they set up the card as ""internal"" which is essentially (but not quite) like having a bigger internal space for everything including apps. This is dangerous and there is a reason why you can no longer do this with newer versions of Android. So unless you have a zillion apps and really need bigger internal space because of your apps, you really should set up the card as Portable Memory instead (no apps on the card, only media and other files, etc.). Then you can decide what types of files to put there AND you can safely remove the card and access it on another device like your laptop (that's why it is called ""portable""). You can choose to have the Kindle app, Prime Movies, etc download to the card. Most people need expanded memory for media, so this makes sense, and again it is safer. You also have good control over what gets stored on an SD card vs internal storage.But, setting up the card as Internal isn't the reason people had issues, because today for the first time I had the issue that others complained about, which is that my card supposedly unmounted and the Fire asked me to re-format. (This would be a bigger problem if I had set it up as ""Internal"" rather than ""Portable""!!). I shut down the Fire, removed the card, and mounted it in Windows. Windows told me there was a problem with the card and I should scan and fix it. I did. Windows showed it as then fine, no further issues. And I had no trouble copying out all the folders from the card to Windows. Returning the card to the Fire still showed the screen for formatting the card, but I'm wondering if this is because the Fire tends to show screens that were on when you shut down. Or else the card was somehow marked as needing a format. The super weird thing, is, when I said to format as Portable Memory, it did so without removing anything. Doesn't formatting a card mean erasing it (or showing it as blank) so you start over with it fresh ?!?!?  I was going to format it however Fire likes to format, and then return the original folders. But I did not need to copy back anything. It is working fine now. So apparently it would have re-formatted only if I had decided to swap from using it as ""portable"" to ""internal."" Probably every time you unmount (""eject"") the card, you will get this message, and it won't really erase everything and reformat, unless you opt to change how you want to use the card. So all is okay with the card, but this situation should not have happened. It probably happened because some function was writing to the card and another function (an update??) dismounted it, thus interrupting the write. This is why Windows had to fix it.So, I think the card issue almost certainly has nothing to do with the particular card, so others' comments are correct about that. (I've been using a new high-quality Samsung Pro Plus card, overkill for a Fire tablet but it was on sale). When the card issue surfaced, I was trying to do some updates from the Appstore and it seemed frozen. (There is still a problem with the Appstore!). So the Fire was not in a good state. It may be a good idea to reboot it occasionally once in a while (I probably hadn't rebooted for about a month). I was also thinking maybe it was trying to update and that broke its normal functionality. Could be. My biggest suspicion. It is on Fire OS 8.3.2.4, from July 3, 2024. I checked for updates even though it showed as last checking today, and it said to tap to install an update, but when I did, everything froze.  I eventually went back to the updater, and now it said I have 1 update (rather than a bunch of gibberish that suggested some pieces were still downloading, and with a broken button for installing, as initially happened). Now I was able to install the update, and when I re-checked for updates, it showed ""no updates found,"" and the Check Now button reappeared as normal. So all seems fine. Other than the fact that my OS still shows as 8.3.2.4. And it still shows it as being from July 3  (today is Aug 7). And I did not get the usual message that my system has updated. It was a secret undocumented thing, or the old update re-installed (why??). Perhaps it was not a Fire OS update but an update of some other built-in component (like the Apstore, or some such thing). The Appstore still seems hung on the page where I update apps. The other parts of it work. It is an issue with the app, because F-Droid can install and update just fine. And my new Fire 10 also works fine, so it is not the server for the Appstore. I'm now thinking it got a corrupted (interrupted?) update and won't work until Amazon has a newer update that I can install on top of it.Amazon, if you are listening: please please be normal about updates. Let your users know there is an update and let them pick when to do the update. If control-freak Apple can do this, you can, too. I do not want to be using my device while it is trying to update (or shutting it down to remove a corrupted card...). That's just asking for trouble. I want to have it plugged in and keep my hands off it for a while. This is a problem with other Amazon devices as well. Okay, you're gonna force an update whether I like it or not, but please, if you don't want to cause a lot of grief, just let people have some control (and awareness!!!!!) when the device needs to be updated. My guess is that even when there is only a minor update (as seems to have been the case for me), the Kindle is not fully functional but pretends to be, and since it is not fully functional (it quits some processes), some unexpected quits will cause corruptions/crashes/SD card issues.....But otherwise it is a good device. Truly. I'm still happy to have it. I love the whale background :-)Initial Review:I got the productivity bundle and I am super pleased. I needed something to take notes with in classes, that also had a touch screen for drawing, and this is great for that. (Amazon Appstore has OneNote and Squid and both are great for notes with this.) In my experience it DOES matter which app you use with the pen because a paint app I tried worked but was slow (so I blame the app, since OneNote and Squid are fine). There is also a fairly new open source app called Saber that seems great (I still need to experiment with that one -- available on F-Droid). I'm thinking that some of the professional reviews (on other web sites) got an early or different version of the pen because the harsh criticisms of it do not match my experience. It works great.This is my 2nd Fire tablet, and I like it so much better than my first one, Fire 8 HD from 2017. I wasn't unhappy with the old tablet when I got it (because I got it on sale for a great price) but I just almost never used it because the screen was so unpleasant and stressful to look at, plus the device was annoyingly slow. Not so with this new tablet -- I am very pleased with the screen quality, and the speed is good for how I'm using it.The pen and keyboard are truly awesome. I wasn't sure at first whether I liked the aspect ratio/shape of the tablet but actually it makes sense. The longer shape allows for nearly full-sized key spacing on the keyboard while not causing the tablet to be unnecessarily large and heavy, as it would be with the iPad's aspect ratio. Someone said they prefer the snap-in clamshell keyboard that is available for the 10, but I much prefer this thin-and-light keyboard (didn't have the 10 but considered it and looked at pics of its keyboard). It is super easy and fast to pull off and snap on the keyboard and it does not need batteries. At home (where I have ""real"" laptops) I use the tablet mostly without the keyboard, and half of the keyboard case stays on it, protecting the back and the camera, and giving the tablet a nice non-slip feel, plus I can use the fold-out stand. I don't use it on my lap at school, and at home I use a lap desk so I don't mind that I can't put it directly in my lap while typing. Really, I have no complaints at all about this setup. Perfect.Well, maybe I can complain a little about Fire OS but it is mostly okay. I would hate it for a phone but it is fine for a tablet. And it is much improved over what I had on my old Fire, especially the settings (I like to have control and info). I put Google Play on my previous Fire but I'm not sure I will do so on this one. I mean I have an Android phone that has things I'd like from the Play store, like my calculator collection and bank apps and whatnot. I don't need to replicate that on this tablet. I've installed F-Droid so I can still easily put a bunch of nice apps on it. I have a Linux terminal app (Termux) and will probably install a small Linux distro with desktop which will further expand the usability. Plus I have a Microsoft 360 subscription from work and it is nice to have an app for that on this tablet too. It has the most critical work apps like Zoom and Teams and Office and Outlook. So it already has what I really need on a tablet. Oh, and Kindle, of course. I think in the past it was almost necessary to side-load Google Play but the Amazon Appstore now has my most critical apps, at least for a tablet. (Yea, it generally is not great and not well maintained, with tons of outdated apps.) Don't be mad at Amazon about Google Play Store, YouTube, etc. It is a Google policy. Google does not want others to take the open source piece of Android and build their own thing on top of it, with no control from Google. There are penalties for doing that. And Amazon couldn't sell its media to you directly on regular Android, so it kind of has to make a separate OS. This is your tradeoff for getting a subsidized tablet. I'm poor so I will accept the tradeoff, especially for a tablet as nice as this one.I paid to get rid of the ads, and I do that on every Kindle or Fire (I value discounts a lot, but aesthetics even more) and now this tablet is a pleasure to use. And soooo much less expensive than a similar setup would have been from Apple.",https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-powerful-display-octa-core-processor/product-reviews/B0B1VQ1ZQY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1

Always have been. I write too, so my main hobby my entire life is reading. Sure, I do love other things, but you will most likely find me if I am awake and not doing anything else? Reading. My reading appetite is voracious as you can imagine and that leads me here. I'm also big into a lot of tech. I was an early adopter of e-readers and ebooks which I scoured irc, libraries, and other places to find ebooks back in ye olden pirate days. Argh. BUT today, things are so much easier. No sailing is required. I even read ahead on series I love and buy the original language ebooks and then translate them into English because today it is so simple to do! And while I read from a great many sources and websites, my kiddo and I read a ton of manga, manhua, and light novels so we hit up Amazon often. Besides getting to directly support the original author (& better publishers), we have a ton of fun swapping novels and reviewing them together. I do own the latest Kindles because one of the Kindle downsides is that you cannot buy content from an iPad or iPhone. Which bites to be honest. I often when traveling if I forgot or didn't want to lug a Kindle have to buy from Google Books or other sites because this is such a pain. I do try to keep up with new releases, but often, the next big book in one of our current 257th favorite series drops and we NEED IT NOW.I own a new huge honking iPad as my main device, and up until now, it has been my favorite to read on. (I have a bit of TED so my eyesight can vary from day to day. Some days I needed extreme readers and the next day just 1.25 is perfect. There's no rhyme or reason but I'm almost through with this the doctors say.) I do love that I can access all my favorite reading sites and spaces via iPad (except for buying Kindle books but I can read Kindle content fine). I can also keep up on my iPad with my favorite Korean and Japanese sites as they update and instantly translate our favorites. (Tech makes reading life good!) If I'm writing, I also use the iPad with a Bluetooth keyboard. My kiddo mainly reads on her iPad mini, but she has her own Kindle too.So what I'm saying is I was not going to buy this. I was like meh, looks nice but, I don't really NEED it. And then my bday came around Black Friday and this made it into my hot little hands. Oh, hello. I thought it was a nice gift but I would probably not keep it because it's really strangely long compared to the iPad. And skinny.BUT let me tell you where it does super well. It is a pleasure to read on. The battery life on this is incredible. I've been sick with walking pneumonia (yay), and have been reading for hours and hours and I'm still at 79% after reading the better part of 12 hours (in between coughing and catnaps here and there)! The battery life is insane. And it just looks lovely, my eyes feel super relaxed without too much adjustment. Manga is very nice on it and nothing looks warped or stretched out. I was worried where I didn't need to be.Now for some books, and I emphasize some, the text/font they chose can be too small for me. If you need big letters some days (or all days) this is not for you. You'll strain. The iPad is much more customizable and utilitarian. No question there. BUT occasionally if I am doing something else and reading on this? If I ask, Alexa will instantly pick up where I left off and read to me. I can get my iPad to do this I suppose, but this level of integration is super nice.I mean you could (or years ago I would have) jailbroke this puppy and made it exactly what it should have been. A real ereader that happened to be capable of other things. The dream of 2005! But now really? Way too much effort and money to get it to basically be like an off-brand iPad-like device from 2005. For most people, this either works because they enjoy reading what they have on it, or they will stick with their iPads.Kiddo and I do a bit of gaming and for that? OML! No. Do not do this. Save yourself! It is super slow. The lag is insane. And it randomly zooms in when it shouldn't and refuses to zoom out. We played Animal Jam just to try it out and it's soooo slow! Same for ebook sites and pages. So slow and too sensitive for taps. This is a one-trick pony and it is Kindle/Amazon. As far as connecting to the internet? No problems. It is just a very slow device. The iPad screams in speed while this slug is barely able to move. I would never trust this for writing (unless I was reading my own writing). It would never keep up with my typing and I don't think my favorite writing apps are even able to run on it.My other real-world problem is there's not a great case for this yet. I'm big into tech protecc. I throw an Otterbox on everything. Once I have everything set up on a device, I don't want to break it and start again. This Max is huge and the glass screen is not going to survive a tumble on my bathroom tile or down the stairs. The one screen saver glass available is too small and did not stay on without massive bubbles. The first silicone case I bought was rubbery junk. The next one I tried was ready and fitted for a keyboard, but I don't want to carry around a keyboard I will rarely use when I have a better Bluetooth one if I need it. The keyboard cases I tried either didn't close well or made this too heavy or too thick to stick into my reader spaces as I read around the house (there are at least two in every room lol). The case I'm using now has a handstrap which is uncomfortable for long hours. The huge honking iPad in an Otterbox case even fits my hand better but battery life? Forget it. The iPad has to be charged off and on all day. This does not only not have to be charged but recharges very fast.Kiddo and I read the same book series yesterday and within an hour she had to plug her mini in. She switched to my new iPad while hers charged and soon that had to be charged too. The Kindle Max was at 83%! So I guess I'm keeping it. I do really enjoy reading on it. So does my kiddo apparently because she keeps borrowing it for manga! She's very nervous about dropping it though so she only reads on it in her bed. I hope there is eventually a good screen protector and case. I have a ton of cases that I tried but all are just terrible that I'm going to now return.SO all in all it's like a C+ to a B- grade. I don't think after all I will gift one to my Mom who is also a big reader because she reads mostly her library ebooks. I think the setup for her outside of directly connecting to her Amazon account will be too much. There are way too many limits between the software and hardware. And she has worse hand arthritis than I do, so I think it will be too uncomfortable for her to hold. She mostly reads on an old iPad. Maybe I'll buy her a new case for that. I would in no way give this to a young kiddo without a very good case. It's bulky and breakable at best.I am also not sure if I would bring this traveling unless there was a good case. Guess I will keep traveling on longer trips with my Kindle Fire 10 since the case is great, it's smaller, and I love that it charges magnetically.It is what it is.",https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-powerful-display-octa-core-processor/product-reviews/B0B1VQ1ZQY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1
Unknown,R2KZYPR306G3ZW,Positive,"Amazon Fire Max 11 tablet (newest model) vivid 11” display, all-in-one for streaming, reading, and gaming, 14-hour battery life, optional stylus and keyboard, 64 GB, Gray",4.4,4.0,"10,135","First off I have two of these, one I set up for my sister and another I have for personal media consumption.I'll start with the cons: no fast charge and I believe this only supports up to 15w charging at max. Lowering the charge time down to about 3.5hrs instead of 4.2, and it ships with a 9w power brick so I recommend using something other than the included brick if you want to knock 30 minutes off charge times.They have a screen protector but they don't provide something like and anti-blue light tempered glass screen protector. The screen is low blue light which is a good thing, but I'm sure consumers would want to generally have the option to additionally add an anti-blue light screen protector anyway ..even better if it's tempered glass for the added protection while retaining visual clarity.There's not too many great cases and the first party one is really pricey. I wish they had also made their own tri-fold smart folio style case as one I got felt like it was designed well but the quality wasn't good. (If they do make a tri-fold case eventually, I hope they make it in more than just three colors and with a tpu backing) or sell the kickstand backing separately from the keyboard.Limited first party apps due to lack of the full android implementation, this also limits the whole productivity portion they're trying to sell to consumers, it does do a handful but don't go expecting this to compare to an ipad or Microsoft surface tablet ..or even a fully Integrated android tablet.For the processor this is pushing, it would've been nice to see this have at least 8gb of RAM, but generally this is competing with the likes of my old Google Pixel 3 XL rather than any full fledged tablets out there. Even then it's only slightly better.And last Amazon either needs to ditch FireOS or update it to a current version of Android, this is still an android tablet running an Amazon skin over it that's about 3 generations behind running android 11. Either Amazon should update it or make a hybrid Operating system that can do both desktop android and tablet, this way programs can be installed to utilize the productivity side of this machine.pros: great screen that runs 2k resolution, colors are nice and vivid with a natural color tone and decent blacks The pixel density at this size means the images are nice and sharp too being squeezed in a smaller form factor. it's not the highest rated HDR but it's far from the worst.The touch screen is pretty responsive with no lag, unless you're playing an extremely graphic heavy game the unit can't handle and you hit deep frame dips where it becomes slow.Speakers aren't too bad, they retain fullness at louder volumes and it does get a decent amount of volume, don't expect it to be loud enough to fill a room though, but the sound chip does it's job well and the Dolby surround is pretty good imo, sounds better through headphones either wireless or wired with a USB-C adapter.Expandable storage! such an ancient yet god tier part of the specs that every piece of tech these days has unfortunately phased out. This tablet supports up to 1TB with a microSD memory card, I hope any future versions keep this feature. I also hope other companies would also go back to using this method of expandable storage.Now as for things I'd like to see in the future if they either plan on updating this version or make future versions.If a revision was made, I'd like to see fast charging, at least 8Gb of RAM with a snapdragon 8 gen 3 mobile chip. I'd also like to see Amazon ditch FireOS and just use the proprietary Android OS or use a hybrid desktop/tablet format, they can just fill it with their bloatware. FireOS just looks really outdated and takes me back to when I had my old 2nd gen fire HD 7"" (not a good look). Maybe it'd be nice if the keyboard had backlit keys. For the love of God add google play store (that alone would make any fire tablet sell like crazy, Amazon is really hurting themselves here and it's embarrassing, listen to the userbase and the money will flow).As for accessories, it'd be nice if Amazon made a tempered glass anti-blue light screen protector, the screen already has low blue light, but it'd be nice to also have that option on top of it.As for covers, why doesn't Amazon make a magnetic cover that rotates from portrait/landscape mode? make a trifold rotation case or a smart folio (preferably with a tpu backing)As for the current version, either do an OS overhaul through a firmware update, Get us past android 11 ..or just completely update the system to fully run android. You have no idea how much people would love to have a customizable home screen and widget with the android experience plus Google would regularly cover security updates for the device.Overall: This is a decent tablet, it's not slow but I wouldn't say it's immediately snappy either in some areas, it's best use case is media consumption and some light mobile gaming. The L1 wifi encoding is great for consistent video playback and I almost never get stream buffering which is nice. The app store is abysmal and the OS is outdated and lacking, I hope people who get this are tech savvy enough to find a way to get the full potential out of this. I opted out of an ipad mini 6, although it is more powerful it doesn't have upgradable storage and is about $250 more expensive, hopefully I don't end up with buyers remorse. I went with a 64GB ad free version and added a 512GB microSD (seems overkill but I play some pretty big mobile games that sometimes hit above 25GB with internal updates in total)Edit: my additional complain is read/write speeds with the microSD card. Naturally, native storage will run faster, so those that got the 128gb don't really have this problem until they run out of storage and have to pop in a card, but even with a A2 Level read/write speed apps saved to the microSD feel a little sluggish at times to open. Hopefully one day there's an update to properly support faster read/write speeds for microSD.For those that got the 64gb version like I did. Save your most used apps on the native storage and your less important ones to a microSD, that way your more used apps will load in faster.Thank you for your review.I'd also like to add that this tablet is pretty hefty, it's not really a pro or a con. The heft adds to a premium feel, holding it while reading will cause some fatigue after about 6 minutes. It's about as heavy as an 11 inch lenovo yoga laptop I own ..and that has a keyboard on it.",https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-powerful-display-octa-core-processor/product-reviews/B0B1VQ1ZQY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1
Unknown,RB4LDX2MDU6A0,Critical,"Mini Projector, VISSPL Full HD 1080P Video Projector, Portable Outdoor Projector with Tripod, Kids Gift, Home Theater Movie Phone Projector Compatible with Android/iOS/Windows/TV Stick/HDMI/USB",4.3,3.0,"1,689","TL;DR:(Update:) After some time, this projector’s sound is okay, brightness gets better in the dark and after warming up, tripod is hard to use though. The customer support is excellent and will help you with your issues. Highly recommend investing in the non-mini version as its improvements are BIG.(Original:) Okay for the price point, came with a lot of accessories like cables and stand. Brightness is what you expect, big issue is significant blurring at the edges especially when keystoning.UPDATE:I wanted to add some comments without removing my original review (below) but I’ve had some extra time with this (mini version only, don’t mix with the higher end one) projector and have warmed up to it a little bit, and feel that the sound is good for what the mini costs. The brightness gets better if you let the light source warm up and works especially well in darkness so turn off your lights! The focus on this get better if you’re willing to adjust it so that it’s closer to perpendicular to the wall, but there’s still some fuzziness.Since my original review, the company has reached out and has communicated with me about my shortcomings with the mini version. Their communication was excellent, and will be happy to assist with your concerns. They sent over their higher end version NON-MINI version for me to consider, and I would say it is definitely the better investment in the budget projector space so go for that one if you can! The higher end one addresses pretty much all the issues I’ve had with the MINI. (more that usually goes in a separate review, but the gist is that the higher-end one is brighter, better focus (less fuzzy edges, more features (mirroring without dongles, much easier to use), comes with a cloth screen, all the usual accessories, and seems to have Android as it’s OS which is a plus in my book). For all the reasons in the parentheses, I would say that the worthwhile version is the non-MINI version.ORIGINAL:The product at the price point I got it was okay, and functioned, came packaged well with a good collection of basic accessories, runs at an okay sound level, however that’s all it really has.I’m not expecting much but the few things I found bothersome were with focus on the edges. If you use the projector from slight angles and try to adjust it with the built in adjusters to get the picture back to a rectangular form it makes one or the other edges fuzzy.Just a quick rundown of the other features that I’m neutral about since this is quite a budget projector: sound is just there, colors… not the best but it’s what you can get, connectivity is good, and brightness needs a fully dark room to appreciate.",https://www.amazon.com/Projector-VISSPL-Portable-Outdoor-Compatible/product-reviews/B0CD2BS3QX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1

Here is my best description of the reason I returned it:I don't know what it looks like on the inside, but I assume there are multiple lenses and I think one of these components is warped. When you try to focus the projector (best-case scenario, straight-on, no keystone/tilt) on the midpoint of an image, you notice the left and right edges are blurry, and the corners are worse. The viewport/screen appears to be properly square on all edges, but it looks like the middle of the image has a different optical index from the outer edges & corners. You try to optimize for average overall focus rather than a point, but then either the top-left or bottom-right corner can be in focus, but not both. Almost like there is a curve on a diagonal on some component inside.As for other issues, which were not the reason for my return (because you get what you pay for):Color is terrible. But, who cares (again, $50).The remote is wiggly. You can deform the thin plastic shell with no effort whatsoever. The buttons are clicky and feel nice to press. I like this remote.The buttons on the top of the unit are... nearly adequate. Best use the funny remote.I like the wall wart power supply, but that is subjective.Included HDMI cable is short, and super cheap.The threaded mount on the underside of the unit protrudes slightly, making it incompatible with some tripod mounts.Also, I really like how smol it is. Very smol. It fits in a backpack nicely.If it weren't for the impossibility of focusing the thing, I would have kept it.Why do I need to peel the serial number off the bottom to clean inside lol",https://www.amazon.com/Projector-VISSPL-Portable-Outdoor-Compatible/product-reviews/B0CD2BS3QX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1

Unknown,R387BQ99VC44BR,Critical,"SAMSUNG T7 Shield 4TB Portable SSD - 1050MB/s, Rugged, Water & Dust Resistant, for Content Creators - Black",4.7,3.0,"13,385","The Samsung T7 Shield Portable SSD is an excellent product. The SSD performance is fast, its housing is quite rugged and may likely withstand reasonable bumps and drops, and it's small enough to fit in your pocket. For size comparison, it is noticeably smaller than most smartphones, and is very slightly larger than a credit card, albeit thicker.The one major disappointment I have with this product is the uncommon limitation on the number of characters you may use for the password when you choose to enable encryption. The maximum number of characters is only 16! This may be good enough for an average user, but those among us (and there are many of us) who take privacy and computer security very seriously will want to be able to implement a password that is longer than 16 characters. As a matter of fact, a strong password should be at least 16 characters, not the maximum!All of my passwords (and I use literally a couple hundred unique passwords) are at least 20 characters in length and most are even much longer. I use Bitwarden as my password manager which makes password management a breeze. With a password manager, all I have to memorize is the master password and it's long and randomly generated (just like all of my passwords).I hope Samsung reads this review and doubles or even triples in a future firmware update the maximum password length allowed for products like this. Because of the lower password maximum length, I had to take off two stars and give this product an overall rating of 3 out of 5 stars, even though everything else regarding this product is excellent. Encryption is a big deal to a lot of people and longer randomly generated passwords make encryption virtually impossible to crack.For those wondering, the Samsung T7 Shield Portable SSD uses AES 256-bit hardware-based encryption, so that by itself is very secure, but only if the password is long and very hard to guess. So I recommend anyone buying this product who wishes to enable encryption (which is optional) to use a very hard to guess password that is the maximum length for this device, which is 16 characters. If one day Samsung raises this limitation, I'll definitely be making my password longer than 16.",https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Shield-4TB-Portable-SSD/product-reviews/B0BHZQGN26/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1

Its primary purpose is to host Kontakt libraries and other things like that, fast temporary space and lots of streaming files from all over the drive. Copying files to and from it achieves the advertised speeds, sequential is good, but random reads are horrid. Crystal Disk mark says that with a queue depth of 1 the read speeds can degrade to an absurd 13 MB/s. I appreciate that random reads are not as fast as sequential ones, but they should not be over 20 times slower on an SSD! Worth noting is that when the queue depth goes up to the unreasonable 32, the random reads perform just as well as you'd expect them to, close to the sequential speeds. So the NAND itself can certainly respond fast enough.  Ever since I set this up I noticed that whenever I would go browsing the folder tree and land in some folder I hadn't viewed yet, my file manager, which is an alternative that is much faster than Windows Explorer, would downright hang for a second while it read the directory. My 8 TB mechanical doesn't do that. The EVO didn't do that. This is NTFS, not EXFAT, so the file system shouldn't be the problem here. And I'm not displaying thumbnails or anything of the sort, so it's not like reading that folder is resulting in an absolute spike of reads to display it. And attempting to use it as a Kontakt sample drive results in Kontakt being completely unable to stream things fast enough, which causes constant drop-outs in the middle of sounds. I'm kind of in a bind as I gave away the prior 2 TB drive, so even if I want to return this I don't currently have a place to put all the data that's already on it. Firmware is updated.

The date speed is very much below the the advertised speed on the listing. I assure you that the speed should be sufficient for most use cases. The speed was actually above my expectations of a USB SSD, even more so when using the USB-C Lightning port(Over 500 MB/s sustained).On that same note the storage is far below whats advertised on the listing, I ordered the 1TB model however my unit only came with 930 GB, that's 70 GB less storage than stated on the product listing! This is 70 GB less than what is stated on the listing! .but unfortunately these deceptive marketing tactics are normal in the digital storage industry.  For anyone buying a Samsung T7 SHIELD I highly suggest they pony up the extra few dollars and buy the 2TB or even the 4TB model instead due to the actual storage being 10s of gigabytes less than advertised on the listing, I suggest buying the higher capacity models to off set the reduction in storage compared to the advertised amount. I sure wish I did get a higher capacity unit, but alas I didn't know I was going to get a drive with 70 GB less than what I paid for!  At the time of writing this review I've only had this SSD for a little over a month, so I am not sure about its longevity or durability due to lack of experience using it however it is well built and sturdy. I have a lot of faith in the durability of this product, its built like a tank! the exterior is wrapped in a hard rubber shell to adsorb shock and enhance durability. the rubber wrapping even extends to protects the edges, even if it lands on an edge its still covered by the rubber exterior shell. I am satisfied with the durability, my unit hasn't suffered any abuse so take my word about this with a grain of salt.One last thing before I wrap this up. I highly advise against the use of the encryption software pre-installed by Samsung. There is far superior and more importantly free and open-source encryption software out there.In conclusion this is a quality rugged portable USB SSD. I have faith that this will survive falling off of my desk plenty of times. The date speed is satisfactory even if it never hit the coveted 1 GB/s.

I transferred all the files and lightening fast it was complete. Transfer is quick. Removed all the copied files from my mac. Went to bed. Woke up to begin doing some programming. Couldn't mount the drive. All of my most important files are gone.Tried Samsung Magician. It wouldnt load unless I disconnected the drive. After other attempts to read it such as using other cables (both that came with it) and ones I have for other drives... nothing worked.I tried disk utility to mount the drive. wouldnt load unless the drive was disconnected. One time it did load but the drive was grayed out and showed not mounted. I used the terminal to mount the disk. No luck. I finally accepted that 6 years worth of work was gone forever.I left the computer plugged in and walked away in an attempt to deal with the stress. I came back the following day to look and viola the drive was mounted. Then it worked for a bit. Tried a few more times and it was up and working. I wrote it off as being from improperly ejecting the drive which never happened on purpose but happened none the less. Here I am few more months down the road. On an international trip. Cant access my files. Dead in the water. Nothing. I plugged in an old SSD from 2012 WD Passport for Mac and it loads within seconds with the same amount of data and it has its own connection type and a usb on the other end. No type C. That drive has been through hell. Years of abuse.,.. still works. I got out two other T5 drives I have both loaded on type c on SSD with usb into the dock mounted to macbook pro. The doc has standard usb connections. Both loaded in 1-2 seconds. T7 still cant be found. Rugged? The thing is babied and only a few months old. Its in a pelican case. The case is kept in a padded computer backpack. First trip out of the house.... nothing. This drive is worthless. It was highly recommended and I am ok with spending premium dollars on premium drives but at this rate a cheap chinese knockoff would perform better. I wish I could get my money back. It is worthless. Bought directly from Samsung. Just as I did the two T5 1TB SSD drives. I see on reddit others are having the same issues. Garbage. Dont buy. Buy the T5 instead or consider WD as I am. I paid premium bucks for trash along with the anxiety of whether I just lost my entire livelihood. I deserve it since I trusted Samsung from years and years of great products. Come to think about it, I had failed USB drives I bought from them recently also. Someone should contact me to fix this or I will be parting ways with Samsung. Unacceptable. I bought all of their premium models when it came to building several PC computers for my dad's business and for my flash storage needs....

If you have a high-quality USB C-to-C cable, it will remain firmly attached to your PC, even if its a laptop you're shifting around - the worst thing is an external HD that disconnects on you easily.  Also, this thing is insanely small - as someone who remembers having to cycle through multiple floppy disks to play a game that was a few megabytes, having 2 terabytes of storage space in a package the weight of a smartphone and half the size is wild.The included USB-C cable is NOT good enough to get you USB 3.0 seeds, which is a cheap move by Samsung, honestly, but with a good 3rd party USB-C cable, I can get write speeds of over 500 megabytes/second on this bad boy, which is amazing. It's more than good enough to play games off of, and in fact, the first thing I did with this was migrate my entire Steam library.That said, I'm knocking off a star not just for the cheap cable, but the fact that the TWO MONTH ADOBE CLOUD SUBSCRIPTION IS A LIE. That wasn't my reason for buying an external SSD at all, but it was a reason I chose this particular SSD over its competitors.I bought the drive, dutifully registered on Samsung's website, and... nothing happened. I called Samsung, waited on hold for 30 minutes, got cycled through various departments and then hung up on, called Samsung back angrily, got hung up on AGAIN, and then on my THIRD CALL, I finally got to someone who admitted - they were out of keys, and had been for a while. Yes, the promo technically does say ""while supplies last,"" which I didn't notice originally, but it's tacky of Samsung and I feel like borderline false advertising not to remove this non-existent ""promo"" now that they know they're out of keys. I think my state's attorney general might be interested in this ""promo"", in fact.But, other than that, the drive IS actually good.

I was underwhelmed.  The read/write speed was exactly the same as my 8 year old external rotating drives.But then I read my old ASUS Z170-A MOBO manual (from 2015) It turns out I've got a well hidden  USB-C slot on the back panel. (Who knew?) I plugged the T7 into that and the read/ write speed must be 10X as fast as before. Screaming fast!Here are some more tips. 1) Don't password protect your drive unless you never forget your passwords.  If you forget it you're screwed. (See tip 2 =>) 2)  If you put confidential data on an SSD and then you decide you don't want it and send it back, you should reformat (overwrite) the drive to erase your data (or just mail it directly to Kim Jong Un in N. Korea.)*****************************************Here's a Day 3 update.  On Day 2 (after writing the above) things deteriorated.  The drive really really does not like being disconnected when  data is being written or deleted.  I was in debug hell for hours trying to recover from corrupted data. But now on Day 3 all seemed ok again (after I reformated the drive!)Bottom line: before unplugging the drive,  make sure you eject the drive and (in Windows Explorer) check that the device icon is gone and/or that the drive is no longer showing up under Device Manager.  Ejecting the drive can be finicky (but is essential.)Ejecting the drive also seems easier, if the device is password protected (but don't forget your password or it's going back to Samsung for a factory reset (you can't do it.) and bye bye data.************************Day 7:  I need to tell  you that I returned the T7 Shield, and - having tested a 2nd one (hope springs eternal) - I've returned that also.  Obviously I really wanted this to work.Why a 3 star review?  I have to wonder whether the finicky performance, data corruption, and difficulty ejecting the drive (principally when plugged into my lone usb-C port) might be due to my 6 year old Skylake system (under Win 10).  The drive was more consistent when plugged into the usb-A port, but was 8 times slower (so, why keep it?)  It did work more consistently with my Intel Gen 11 (Rocket Lake) laptop where I saw 250 MB/sec read/write speeds; but even there ejecting the drive from a usb-C port was difficult (and hence rendered it prone to data corruption.)I really wanted to make this work, but - alas - it was not to be.

As a professional photographer, I’ve used a wide range of cameras over the years, and the R6 Mark II stands out as one of the best for capturing stunning photos with ease and precision.One of the most impressive features of this camera is its focus tracking. It’s nothing short of amazing how accurately and quickly it locks onto subjects, even those in motion. Whether I’m photographing wildlife, sports, or portraits, the focus tracking never fails to deliver sharp and clear images. This capability has elevated my photography to a whole new level, allowing me to capture moments with incredible detail and clarity.The R6 Mark II also offers excellent low-light performance, thanks to its high ISO sensitivity and advanced image stabilization. I’ve been able to shoot in challenging lighting conditions without compromising image quality, which is a huge plus for anyone who loves shooting at night or indoors.Additionally, the camera’s ergonomic design makes it comfortable to hold and easy to operate, even during long shooting sessions. The menu system is intuitive, and the touchscreen display is a pleasure to use.Overall, the Canon R6 Mark II has exceeded my expectations in every way. It’s a reliable, high-performance camera that’s perfect for both amateur and professional photographers alike. Whether you’re upgrading from another model or looking for a powerful camera to start your photography journey, the R6 Mark II is a fantastic choice that won’t disappoint.",https://www.amazon.com/Canon-EOS-Mark-Mirrorless-Oversampling/product-reviews/B0BL7ZVY78/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1

I decided it was time to replace my 13-year old Canon 7D, and I chose the Canon R6 Mark II. I'm very happy with it. I was considering buying the R8, but when I held it, I realized it was too small to fit comfortably in my hand. (I'm just an average size guy, with average male hands.) The R6 Mark II is 1/4"" taller so it fits my hand better than the R8, plus it has a better viewfinder (especially important for glasses wearers like me), plus it has in-camera image stabilization. To me, those were the features that justified the extra price.Compared to my old Canon 7D, the new R6 Mark II has *much* better focusing, better resolution (more than the extra 6 megapixels would suggest), and shoots in much lower light. With the 7D, ISO 1600 was the highest I could go if I wanted good image quality, but the R6 Mark II can easily go up to ISO 12800. Heck, even ISO 56000 works for casual use.The camera has TONS of customizations. So if you like to tinker and read user manuals, you will be in heaven.One of the cool new features is focus stacking. This lets you take a close-up picture of something and get the whole thing in perfect focus, front to back. The camera takes many individual shots, each at a slightly different focus point, and stitches them together in-camera. It works best with a completely still subject and a tripod, so I won't be using it a lot, but it is cool.I was wondering how much I would like the electronic viewfinder, and it turns out I prefer it over a ""real"" viewfinder that older DSLR cameras like my 7D have. The biggest benefit is at night because the viewfinder is brighter; this makes the camera easier and more fun to use.",https://www.amazon.com/Canon-EOS-Mark-Mirrorless-Oversampling/product-reviews/B0BL7ZVY78/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1

I use this for video so I have no review on this if you're wanting to use this for photography. For video, I love the colors that come out of this and the autofocus is pretty good. It can be a little jumpy at times but usually locks on pretty well.Some flaws. The biggest flaw is that you can't use the camera's lcd while using a monitor and be able to record internally in camera. This means that if you want to use a monitor, you will either lose the ability to use the camera's lcd screen (so not touch to focus or any touchscreen features), or you'll be able to use both but won't be able to record internally so you'll need a monitor that has a recording option such as the Atomos Ninja V. If I had known about this before buying, I probably wouldn't have bought it.Another flaw is you also lose display screen info once you start recording so your histogram disappears once you hit that record button.One flaw I've never experienced in another camera before until using the R6ii is when you pair this camera with a lens that has Image Stabilization and mount it on a gimbal. It has these weird 1-2 frame micro jitters every few seconds that will ruin your footage.

My 5D2 left nothing to be desired in the image quality dept. and honestly I’m still more comfortable with it for stills while continuing to familiarize myself with the R6mk2.

I can easily kill 1 battery shooting stills for a couple of hours. The exact same battery lasts days in my 5D2.The electronic viewfinder looks and feels unnatural, or unreal, but not in a good way. I’ve learned that I really prefer optical viewfinders.I miss using the top LCD menu on older bodies to set AF type and more importantly ISO! The m.fn menu works but feels too clunky especially while looking through the viewfinder.The Auto ISO feels a bit disjointed more often than not.I’m very happy with the R6mk2 and I’m sure the more familiar I become with it, my dislikes will decrease. It was a nice upgrade and very versatile. I can’t say that it being mirrorless makes any difference in my use case. But for video it blows my 5D out of the water and is a game changer for me. I would’ve probably been just as happy with the R8 with the exception of its battery life, or even an APSC crop body, just because of how old the DSLR technology I use is (5Dmk2 primarily and 50D/T3i as a backup bodies).I hated how expensive the EF to RF adapter was but I didn’t want to get a cheap 3rd party one and have it give me problems while shooting.If you’re in the fence coming from an older generation of DSLRs you’ll probably be impressed by the R6mk2.",https://www.amazon.com/Canon-EOS-Mark-Mirrorless-Oversampling/product-reviews/B0BL7ZVY78/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1

Picture quality was great. But things started going south pretty quickly. The remote is wonky. You click a button and nothing happens, you try again, and nothing. You contort yourself to get different angles and finally it scrolls forward or raises the volume or whatever you wanted. But then it keeps going, like it stored all those button presses and ran them all at once. It is marginally better using my phone app to do these things.  It has the same problem only less often. The problem with the app is that sometimes it randomly severs the connection and you can’t turn it on. It then wants you to go through a whole diagnostic process which took about 15 minutes. Unplug it, plug it back in, check the WiFi, check some other crap. I am starting to get nostalgic for the days when I got up pushed the button on the tv to turn it on, turn the channel with a knob, even old tube tvs which took a few seconds to warm up are faster than this crap sometimes.The external speaker feature is also crap. I have a home theater than is a few years old, that works perfectly on my old tv or when I listen to music via Bluetooth, but only randomly works with this tv. We will be watching, and it works great. Turn off the tv and turn it on later and no sound. Play with the settings for a while and eventually you just use the tv speakers. But the next time you turn it on, it decided to use the home theater and maybe sound comes through the home theater but mostly it doesn’t. Their tech support is useless here. They have a list of algorithms for you to walk through, and when those don’t work, they give up and tell you it’s not the TV but the home theater. Finally the “Smart” features are anything but Smart. Trying to add apps, put them on the screen in some semblance of order is not intuitive with this machine. This is such an ugly process that I guess enough people complained, that tech support actually has an effective algorithm that they can help you set it up.

I made the leap and purchased this. Was delivered fast and up my 16 steps to my porch. TV is great! Easy to unbox by myself and carry inside. Packaging is excellent. Lightweight. I hooked it up immediately and noticed a HUGE difference in quality. The characters from The Hobbit I was watching looked so incredibly almost AI generated. The colors are so vibrant and vivid. I’m a huge gamer and hooked my Xbox up and it made everything so dynamic and better. The quality in picture is there. Some reviews said sound quality is terrible. I think the sound is good. I have a soundbar with an optic cable I haven’t figured out how to connect to this. But I love that I can say goodbye to my ROKU as this has WIFI Connectivity and all my apps are already pre-loaded.

I turned it on once, and I’m pretty sure I haven’t left my couch since. This thing sucks you into content like it’s a portal to another dimension—where Netflix asks, “Are you still watching?” and the answer is always yes.Picture Quality:The 4K resolution is so sharp, I swear I saw every individual pore on an actor’s face during a close-up—though I’m not sure I needed that level of intimacy with my favorite sitcom stars. Colors are so vibrant it feels like a Pixar movie exploded on my wall, and now I can’t go back to reality. Seriously, the grass on this TV looks greener than my lawn, and now I think my grass is just being lazy.Sound:The built-in speakers are surprisingly good! But do they make me feel guilty about not upgrading to a soundbar? Of course. It's like the TV is whispering, “I’m good, but imagine how much better I could be...” Sneaky.Smart Features:It’s got all the apps you can dream of—Netflix, Disney+, HBO, and about 12 others I didn't even know existed. My Roku looked at this TV, packed its bags, and left because it knew it wasn’t needed anymore. Also, the remote is so sleek that I lost it within 20 minutes, but it felt like a good excuse to try Samsung’s phone app remote control—turns out, that works like a charm too.Verdict:This TV has become the MVP of my living room—whether I'm watching a blockbuster or just admiring the menu screen because I can't decide what to watch. It's elegant, ridiculously clear, and smarter than me (but that's not saying much).5/5 stars!

Called Epson customer service and after several minutes they said it had a defective hardware issue and could not be fixed by phone support.  they connected me to warranty dept.  Incredibly, the warranty department put every conceivable obstacle in the way to honoring warranty.  they wanted the Amazon reciept, which they made me take a scree shot of and send them.  then once i did that, they said that wasn't acceptable as it didn't show if it came from 3rd party seller. I said. ""what difference does that make"".  the reciept showed me as the purchaser, the exact product description and date of purchase and delivery and amount paid.  what else more did they need.  So after 20 minutes of back and forth with Epson on this, they said they'd accept the Amazon reciept.  so then they were going to send me another if i sent the defective one  back first.  I didn't trust that as if i sent it back without the replacement first, and then they just neve sent the replacement, i'd be SOL.  so they said they would charge my credit card the amount of the defective printer and mail me the replacement first and issue me a credit when the defective one got to them.  but then they said i was giving them invalid credit card info and they could not process warranty claim.  I knew the credit card info was accurate and called Discover customer service on another line and put them and Epson customer service on speaker phone to basically create a 3 way call.  Discover said that the Epson person was inputing address incorrectly and thats why it was getting rejected. Epson had my full printed address from Amazon reciept and the Discover representative and myself repeated the address to the Epson rep again to him verbally.  but he still said he could not process warranty claim and that we were giving him wrong address.  In summation after two hours, it became plain Epson refused to honor their warranty by all these fake receipt and address issues that did not exist.  I ended up calling Amazon and explained all this to them and how Epson kept me on the phone for two hours and would not honor warranty.  so Amazon took it back.  So i am returning it to them.  So for me, I will never buy an epson product ever again. they refuse to honor their warranty.  defective right out of the box and all the above occurs.

The last print we made on the old printer was perfect. The printer said to contact Epson for service which I did and was told that the printer was out of warranty and they would not service it.

There is no comparison in the build quality of the two printers.  The ET-4800 looks and feels like a cheap toy.  And then there are problems setting up and using the machine.First, the instructions say that the printer will automatically find your wireless network and connect once you put in the password, and the instructions also say you don't need the app for this.  My unit did not locate the wireless network.  It led me through the fax set up and then stopped setting up.  I had to go into the control panel to find the wifi instructions and then connect manually.  Furthermore, there was no guidance on how to switch among upper case letters, lower case letters and numbers and symbols in the set up when entering the password.  It was trial and error before I figured out how to do this.  All very frustrating.And entering my password was hampered by the fact that the control panel is far too small, as other reviewers have noted.  The control panel is difficult to see with for anyone with poor reading vision.  I had to use glasses with a strong magnification.The printer does not come with a usb cable, rather cheap of Epson I thought.  So if you like a wired connection to your computer, as I do to avoid the vagaries of a wifi connection, you have to provide one yourself.Unlike my Epson 830, the 4800 loads paper from the rear only.  This limits where you can locate the printer.  I have my 830 under my desk but that is an awkward location for a rear loading machine and I will now have to do some rearranging to be able to place the 4800 printer on my desk.There is no automatic access to the printer's output tray.  You have to pull it out and close it manually.  The paper load and the output tray both seem very flimsy and I wonder how long it will be before they break.There is no automatic two-sided printing.  After setting the two-side option through your computer you have to manually turn over the paper for printing on the second side.  Epson should do better than this at such price for a printer.In designing this printer I have the impression that Epson looked for ways to cut costs to make up for the fact that, at least as they claim, you will use less ink than on cartridge models.  Ink is where manufacturers have traditionally made money, which allowed them to keep the costs of printers down.  Now, with more efficient ink usage it seems that Epson are cost-cutting on the printers themselves.I cannot recommend this printer.  But then again, I'm sure I'd say the same thing about most other eco models.PS. I would now add that the printer is extremely slow.  I timed the last page that I printed and it didn't have much text.

So, the difference in cost is striking.Unboxing the printer was simple enough.  The printer weighs about half the weight of my old Epson printer.  The new printer does not have printer drawers but, back feed only.  This actually worked out well for me since I was constantly taking the paper in out and out of the drawers when changing paper size.  Also, with this direct paper feed, I figure it will handle my heavier weight card stock paper that I use for my art and greeting cards.  To my great surprise, the printer offers two-sided printing.  This is really handy when printing my Zines.  The printer setup was extremely easy as they recommend a phone app, that walks you through each step with pictures.  And it communicated perfectly with the phone for the setup.  It takes about 15 minutes to completely set up the printer. I have learned to not rush setup.  Take your time, and follow the instructions step by step, Which include filling the tanks.Features,* The printer dues Dual-Sided Print - Great for zines.* It has fax capability, but we do not have a landline, so that will not be used.* It does copying, with a document feeder or you can lift the feeder and place the document on the glass.* I mostly use my Epson Precision San copier but it is nice if you wish to make a quick copy of a document.* Some reviews complained about the very small LED display but I find that by using the app or computer I can control all that I need to do.Print Alignment.  I did this test but the printer heads did not require any alignment.During the setup process, the program installs the printer driver on my computer.  However I found it to be the very basic driver, and I went to the Epson Website and downloaded and installed the latest driver which is very robust and has all the settings that I needed.The printer's footprint is smaller than my old printer. And my old printer had two paper drawers, though I never used the second drawer.Negatives.The output tray is flimsy and seems like it would easily break if bumped when I walked past the printer, so I have to be careful about this.So far I do not see a way of checking the ink levels from the computer.  And they said in the instructions to be sure to check your ink levels.  You can see on the front of the printer, where you can see the ink levels.  When you purchase more ink, you can attach the bottle and it will not overfill the tanks, and you can then use more ink from the bottle later.  So I will purchase a complete set of ink and keep it and as it runs low with about 1/4 left in the tank, I will just fill it up.So far I am very happy with the investment and now printing and ink cost is not a major factor.  And I figure I will do a lot of printing with this printer when the holiday season rolls around for my greeting cards.As for print quality, I will need to report on this later, though there were no negative reviews of print quality.  A test print on regular paper and the colors seemed to be spot on.One note, I still will continue to use my Canon Pro-300 Wide Printer for my Fine Art Prints, but the new Tank Printer will be my studio workhorse.",https://www.amazon.com/Epson-Wireless-Cartridge-Free-Supertank-Ethernet/product-reviews/B09P45LR5T/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1

It was easy to install and adding the ink to each tank was easy, just match the ink color to the tank color. It works well.

The rollers tend to jam the paper pushing originals thru. I was displeased with this and the scanning software was the cloud again, at the bottom you can chose a folder to save to, also I used the ADF feed instead of default (or glasstop is ok), and the box (click) where you can choose to add a page or save will bring up a second screen for choices.

As compared to the method using applique sheets adhered to fabric, dye-sub infiltrates the dyes into fabric fibers, producing a comfortable, durable, washable shirt.  Once functional, this printer does this very nicely. You can also decorate ceramic mugs and other hard surface objects with this process.Be aware that the ink that comes in the package is NOT dye-sub ink - you need to order it separately. Both types of ink are quite inexpensive compared to typical photo-printer ink tanks. Filling the printers ink tanks is a neat, mess-free process.  The ink bottles seal onto the tank inlets, and fill them by gravity.The NOT SO GOODInstalling the print driver was not a smooth process.  Wi-fi connection is recommended, but USB or wired ethernet are also possible.  Entering my router password on the tiny viewing screen on the printer was difficult. It took me a while to realize that there is a three-way shift button for upper case, lower case, and number/symbol.  After managing to enter the password the first time, I touched the physical 'OK' button on the printer front -- WRONG -- that made me start over again.  Instead there is secondary 'OK' button on the tiny screen.  On the third try, the printer screen indicated successful Wi-fi connection.Then I tried to proceed with the driver installation on my Windows 11 computer. After ""searching for printers"" for a minute or so, the software reported ""NO PRINTER FOUND"".  I then connected a wired ethernet cable, and tried again -- ""NO PRINTER FOUND"".  I found the tech support phone number (a good thing), but it was Sunday, so that was not an option.  I rebooted everything, and ran the driver installation again, with same result.Then I looked in Windows settings, saw the ET-4800 printer listed, and printed a test page -- successfully!  The printer has functioned fine so far since then. A few more details in the installation instructions would have saved me a lot of frustration.The print-head alignment process is also done on the tiny screen.

Got lots of good use from it. The new eco tank fill is even better than the original. It was always an economical option… it is less messy now. Here is the reason for this post. If you are planning this for a home office you need to note two “shortcomings”. First, there is no paper tray. You load from the back of the printer and it only holds a minimum amount of sheets if paper. While it does print wirelessly, you may run out of paper quickly. The second issue may not bother you, but while you can do two sided printing, you cannot do it remotely as the paper has to be re-inserted manually.

For one, the tanks, when filled are supposed to last for a year or more. Refills for all colors are around $50. The refill package for cartridges on my HP were $90, and they don’t last near as long (so far), even though the color cartridges were rarely used.Two gripes keep this a four star rating. Printing on both sides requires manually turning the sheets of paper over, you select the feature before printing on HP. The other gripe is the info screen on the printer. It is literally the size of a postage stamp and is very difficult to see and even harder to make selections on. I knew this before purchasing but thought the Epson phone app was designed to duplicate the screen, therefore making the physical screen size irrelevant. Wrong.HP now makes a refillable tank model and I would have to consider it. , knowing what I know now. The Epson has a smaller footprint, prints well, but doesn’t seem to be as sturdily made.

At that point, I did not want to invest any extra money in a HP printer so asked for the refund.The HP Escalation Team was very reasonable and communicated with me throughout the whole process of sending me a check for the exact amount I originally paid to Amazon and then asking me to send back the original printer and just discarding the defective replacement.This took a lot of phone calls from me to get to the Escalation Team  but I was so done at that point once the replacement was not even working. So, I stand by the original review to AVOID this printer but HP does have excellent customer service and, in this case, they did everything I requested to make this situation right and give me some closure.I wouldn't write off HP as a company but maybe get a less flimsy and completely inept model. If you do get really stuck, contact HP because they did do their best to find a resolution and genuinely seemed to care after I kept insisting for a refund or different model printer.If you do contact HP with any issues, I recommend asking for a supervisor or referral for your case to the escalation team if it's something really serious or frustrating. Typically, you have to deal with customer service via a chat platform but you can request a supervisor there.The empathy I received from HP helped to defuse the situation and restored my respect for the company. Technically, I was beyond the return window and HP didn't have to do anything at all, but they listened t my concerns with sincerity. They first tried resolving it by sending a replacement printer and then supported my subsequent decision to get the heck out of Dodge and abandon ship.Thank you, HP! You truly do stand by your core values: ""We are a technology company born of the belief that companies should do more than just make a profit. They should make the world a better place.""=================================================ORIGINAL REVIEW FROM EASTER 2024:This is the worst printer I have ever bought in my entire life! The first model had the top snap off from the tiny plastic hinge which held it, then I contacted tech support for HP and was told by the representative that they couldn't help me since it was a ""customer induced"" problem!I attached pictures; you can see the one cheap plastic that is supposed to bear all of the weight of the heavy cover -- feels like at least 2 pounds as it's lifted up and down.Then I explained that was inappropriate, accusing me of basically breaking the printer on purpose and calling me a liar! Finally after another hour of insistence, the representative agreed to send me a replacement printer which I JUST GOT delivered on Friday!!!Now it is EASTER SUNDAY and was just trying to photocopy a simple document to bring with me to the family gathering and am spending it with HP support again -- they want to troubleshoot why there are BLINKING RED ERROR LIGHTS and the printer keeps making humming sounds, moving around, not printing or photocopy, and now none of the buttons do anything when I press them! I contacted support, requesting a REFUND or a DIFFERENT MODEL and the representative just keeps saying they want to ""troubleshoot"" and do technical support!!!I never wrote a bad review on Amazon like this after almost 20 years of ordering on here. But this is RIDICULOUS, I never had so many ISSUE because of a PRINTER! No wonder why Amazon is offering it right now for 40% off, down to $60 from the $99 I paid for it!!!  DO NOT GET THIS PRINTER, you will REGRET IT.. It is Easter and I am just so frustrated by this device!Why can I not click the PHOTOCOPY button like I have with every other printer I ever owned in my life and watch the printer spit out a simple black and white page?Even the PIXMA which I had for over 5 years never did this, and that seemed pretty cheaply made too! But the cover never broke off, and it never let me down! I've had DELL, BROTHER, CANON, EPSON.. none of them had the cover bust off just from trying to scan a document! Now I just get a replacement and then I can't even make a basic one-page photocopy? And then I have to spend HOURS trying to get support, entering my phone number 5 times to finally get to a live agent?YOU WILL RUE THE DAY YOU BUY THIS PRINTER!!  DO NOT MAKE THE MISTAKE I DID! I am on the verge of just throwing this printer into the DUMPSTER for the satisfaction of being FINISHED with it this complete waste of $100 if HP does not give me a refund or send a different model!!I WISH I BELIEVED THE POOR REVIEWS ON HERE.. they are TRUE! I wish I had listened... please save yourself this complete mental stress and feeling of BETRAYAL that what I thought was a reputable brand, would let me down in SO MANY WAYS!!If you do choose to ignore my warning -- and again I have never left a review like this and do not think I even have left any negative reviews -- then when it BREAKS on you and you realize what a total piece of JUNK this is with its CHEAP lightweight PLASTIC and apparent electronic issues... then just remember this review.. and then you'll be in my position, leaving a negative review.. saying to yourself, ""Darn, I really should have listened to that guy... he was RIGHT!""I've had a BROTHER laser printer for five years... it never let me down..

Not office friendly or organizational friendly either. It's very light weight, which can be a positive but it's too lightweight that it's clear to see how cheaply it was made. One bump of a baby finger can send the printer flying off the desk. Also it does not have a place to hold the unused paper and the paper you place in the feeder only holds a few or else it gets jammed. There is no easy way to copy front & back of something without waiting until all front sides are printed then you turn the paper over yourself & feed it through again to print. It's not automatic. To make a photocopy is an annoyance too. If copying/scanning from a physical book or paper, you need to make sure you hold the top down the whole time you're copying or else it doesn't work correctly. To install the program onto a laptop or computer with a wifi signal, I was asked numerous times for very sensitive info which had really nothing to do with just installing a printer program. I didn't like that. Also it says you can use it over wifi and without wifi but everytime I try to do it without wifi it has an error/prompt message saying I need wifi to print/scan/copy. Plus no matter what there's always a delay when printing. Instead of immediate printing it takes a few seconds to a few minutes for printing to begin.  I do like though you can click the info button & wifi button on the printer and it tells you if something isn't working correctly and every last detail about the printer and signals and addresses available. Overall it's ok for one single person like a young kid who doesn't need tons of sheets being printed at once or if you don't need front and back often or to be organized like an office setting . If your going to use it like me for homeschooling stuff, office work, and printing photos, I'd say buy a way better one . This is good as a 1st time all in one printer for someone who is on a budget and doesn't care or has the time to do lots of extra steps to print/scan/copy something, as a college kid would. I'm keeping it for now but I don't expect it to last more than a couple months,  if that. .. update after using it for a month.. the ink runs out sooooooo fast its annoying.

Granted if you're scanning more than one page chances are you're close enough that connecting a cable isn't a major hassle, but nice convince not to need it.Will say when scanning music it does a better than average job of scanning for software recognition and not much correction of notes is needed which is generally not the case.The LCD screen is pretty useless.  It shows if you have a wireless signal or not and shows an i when needs attention such as a paper jam or out of paper. Then has 4 manual buttons 1- turns wireless on/off 2- has a sheet of paper with an arrow to start printing again if paper ran out, 3- black copy, 4 - color copy.Previous printer the LCD screen let you manage copy settings by increasing or decreasing darkness, enlarging or shrinking image, and designating multiple copies. None of those features are available despite supposedly comparable printer.Major blunders1-No auto document feeder2-Printer is offline more often then not3-Printer is always offline when initially attempt to print from mobile device, but then will respond to signal. Unfortunately some applications refuse to print after initial offline/unavailable message4- rear paper tray needs an overhaul5- manual double sided printing doesn't work well6- rear paper tray combined with catch tray take up extreme amount of spaceSave yourself the grief and stick with a printer with an input tray under the printer that also does auto double sided printing. This is junk. Had we realized how much grief it was to be a temporary solution would have been done until  something reasonable could be done. HP unfortunately had a window where the only office quality/feature functioning printers available were not home office friendly. 7 months and though printer works fine it's likely going to be replaced.Getting ink seems difficult as well.

As my workplace has transitioned to mainly electronic records, I didn't need a heavy-duty workhorse – just a reliable printer at a reasonable price point. Enter the HP DeskJet 4155e.For my needs, this printer delivers a solid performance. While it may not be perfect, it gets the job done efficiently. One of its strengths is the printing speed, which is relatively fast for basic document printing. The printer is also user-friendly and straightforward to operate, making it a convenient choice for a small office setup.However, I did notice that the ink cartridges seem to deplete faster than some other models I've used in the past. This could be a concern for those with higher printing volumes, but for my current low-to-moderate usage, it's a manageable trade-off.The setup process, which some reviews had flagged as difficult, went surprisingly smoothly for me. I was able to get the printer up and running without any major hiccups, which was a relief.In terms of print quality, the DeskJet 4155e delivers crisp and clear results, whether for text documents or graphics. It's not the quietest printer out there, but the noise level is tolerable and shouldn't cause significant disruptions in a typical office environment.One notable limitation, however, is the lack of duplex (double-sided) printing capability. This feature would have been a welcome addition, especially for those looking to save paper and reduce waste.Overall, the HP DeskJet 4155e Wireless Color Inkjet Printer is a solid choice for those seeking a reliable, affordable option for light office printing needs. While it may not be loaded with advanced features, it strikes a good balance between performance and value. If your printing requirements are modest and you're working with a tight budget, this printer is definitely worth considering.",https://www.amazon.com/HP-DeskJet-Wireless-included-588S6A/product-reviews/B0CT2QHQVF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1

I’d give this printer a solid B+ for ease of setup on my iPhone 15 and MacBook Air. Sure, I ran into a few bumps along the way, but after a couple of tries and about 30 minutes, I finally got it up and running.However, as someone with multiple health challenges, I found swapping out the ink cartridges to be a bit of a struggle. I’ve owned several HP printers over the years, and with most of them, you could easily lift the scanner bed to install the cartridges. But with the HP4255e, there’s a tight front flap near the paper exit that makes it tricky. If you don’t get the cartridge in just the right spot, it can take a bit of wrestling to get it seated correctly. I really wish it had a top-loading option instead.Another hiccup was the printing delay. There were times when I’d hit “print” on both my phone and laptop, only to wait around three minutes before hearing the printer start to pull the paper in, followed by another 90 seconds of silence. A few times, it actually finished printing about 15 minutes after I first hit “print,” but more often than not, it just stalled out. I tried everything I could think of—uninstalling and reinstalling the HP Smart app on all my devices, unplugging the printer, and even going through tech support for over an hour. Unfortunately, even with their guidance, the inconsistencies persisted. It wasn’t until after my call with them that I realized I should try printing directly through the Smart App on my phone, and that finally worked for me. So, I’m left unable to print from my laptop, which is a bit frustrating.Oh, and I must admit, I was a bit disappointed to discover there’s no automatic duplex printing. That’s more of a personal preference, but it did catch me off guard. Honestly, I’d only recommend this printer to someone who prints infrequently and is okay with using the app.On a positive note, when it does print, the quality is beautiful! However, I’m puzzled as to how I went through almost half of my color ink cartridge in less than 24 hours after getting the machine. I only printed about 10 pages, mostly black and white with just a few colored elements.

Unknown,R1AFOOZBK8TM8B,Critical,"NEW Bose SoundLink Max Portable Speaker, Large Waterproof Bluetooth Speaker, Up to 20 Hours of Battery Life, USB-C, Built-in 3.5mm AUX Input, Black",4.6,3.0,389,"I highly doubt you'll find a better sound in a similar package. What drew me in was the promise of improved stereo effect using Bose's effective Articulated Array. It does that wonderfully. It's incredible how effective it can be when the drivers are literally inches apart. While not perfect (the soundstage is large, but imprecise--a physical limitation of a narrow device), it creates a large sound atmosphere that is VERY well suited for live music. Listening to live albums through this is a genuine delight.Bass is great for the size. It won't give you full extension, but it's compact, so it's unreasonable to expect it to. Just judging by my ear, I think this is effective down to about 65Hz and smoothly rolls off below that. At low to moderate volumes, you can easily imagine you're listening to a large home stereo.Mids are.. unique, in a mostly-good way. There is a lot of processing going on in this frequency range that aids the stereo effect. In typical fashion, this means imprecision and a slightly-off tone, but the tradeoff is well worth it for this device class and form factor. Your ears will adjust quickly and it'll sound pleasant and realistic enough. You will likely find it subtly emphasizing details in songs that you've never paid attention to. It's kind of fun, honestly. Novel, but not offensive.Highs are a mixed bag. They're fairly smooth and detailed, but being a single tweeter in the center, all the detail is right there in the middle. In ordinary listening, you won't really notice.. especially if you're moving around or off axis. But it's something possibly worth mentioning.It all combines to a unique, pleasant experience. It's well-processed, but processed nonetheless. It's an impressive sounding speaker making the very best of its modest, portable size.But the price is just too high. I've long felt that Bose's Flex is the best combination of outstanding sound, overall quality, and price. I don't think this is enough of an upgrade over that to cost nearly 4x as much. And if you don't mind fussing with Bluetooth stereo pairing, two Flexes will give you an awesome, authentic stereo sound for about half the price of this. You'll only miss out on just a little bit of bass extension/emphasis, but everything else about the Flex sounds as good or better. It's a no-brainer to me.Battery life is outstanding at low to moderate volumes, btw. When camping, I had it playing lightly most of the night (~8hrs) and it only dropped around 20%. Crazy.A welcome addition is the 3-band tone control (bass, mids, treble). They're fairly well-spaced and nicely adjustable. That said, I barely touched it (bass 0, mids +1, treble +2). It sounds great right out of the box.Feature-wise, it's fairly basic, but I kind of like it that way. It's just a good, simple speaker. Happily, they included an aux input! If your TV has level-adjusted RCA analog output (Vizio does, many don't), you could practically use this as a nice little soundbar in a small to medium sized room, which was compelling to me as I was considering soundbars for my bedroom. I don't know if I'll bother doing that, but it is an option if it makes the price more palatable.But yes, the price is too high for my tastes. I think many people will find it worth it, but $299 would be a far more reasonable price (preferably even less, but this IS a luxury product).Ultimately, I don't know if I can recommend it. It's impressive, but not quite enough to justify the cost.Also possibly of note, my Bluetooth has disconnected periodically. I'm confident that it'll be improved with a firmware update eventually, but I still want to mention it. Sadly, that's just how things are--as things get more and more tech-heavy, everyone releases imperfect products once in a while, and Bose is no exception. Fortunately, most kinks can be worked out with simple updates. I won't hold this against it because it's so new.BASS 90/100MIDS 85/100HIGHS 80/100DETAIL 85/100SOUNDSTAGE 85/100BATTERY 100/100QUALITY 95/100---VALUE 65/100OVERALL 80/100RECOMMENDED?

What an amazing first impression.  Excellent soundstage.  Wide, detailed, clear, everything you could want.Unfortunately, once you take the volume to even close to 50%, which you'd want to do in many situations and certainly outside, and it all falls apart.  Hero to zero in the blink of an eye.The bass has a fart-like quality to it which ruins everything.  The only way to make this sound acceptable is to use the EQ to take the bass pretty much to nothing or even a negative setting.  In which case, you could buy almost any other Bluetooth speaker for less than half the price that is going to sound just as good.Many of the reviews talk about bass and presence, but that's only true at really low levels.  At least assuming the unit I was sent is working to factory spec.And don't get me wrong, I'm not listening to music at window rattling levels designed to annoy the neighbors.  I'm not even listening to tracks that I think are especially bass heavy.As an example I listened to Clocks by Coldplay.  Hardly a hardcore bass fest.  The opening bars sounded amazing.  But as soon as the gentle bass chords joined the music, the speaker lost itself.I tried the product on a hard wooden stool.  A hard wooden deck.  A patio table.  A different patio table.  A few feet away.  A few meters away.  It really didn't matter.  I played with numerous EQ settings.  But the bottom line is that it just can't put out bass in any real capacity unless you are willing to lower the sound to a background volume.  In which case, it's amazing.  To me, the bass being available in such a quiet and tiny sweet spot, makes it kind of worthless to include it at all.  I have a pair of B&O Explore speakers, that sound amazing and can be set as a stereo pair.  If you buy them well you can have two of them for $100 less than this Bose.  What they lack in bass, they more than make up for in incredible sound stage, stereo separation and can go toe to toe in terms of detail.  The thing is, they also KNOW they can't do much bass, so they don't even try.  Bose, is trying too hard to make bass happen that apparently isn't possible in this system.Just like I don't drive my car at 100 mph ever, I want it to be capable of that.  I want it to accelerate from zero to sixty in under seven seconds, even though it's not how I drive.  And when it comes to speakers, I want to know that if I want to turn up the volume a little, it isn't going to sound like a box of farts.I tried to give it every opportunity to impress, but it failed at everything except very quiet listening levels.  I was mainly streaming from Apple Music, and I even looked for songs offered at their highest bitrate or including spacial audio technology.  For the price they are charging, there is no way I keep this item.  It is already in the box ready to go to UPS.Maybe it would be different if you have a different sound source, are using a different streaming service, are using AUX or Android.  My tests were iOS based, and bluetooth streaming.

That just goes to show you that they have no intentions of buying another speaker because this probably cost so much, they can’t afford to buy another one.I'm writing this review with a heavy heart, as a lifelong Bose enthusiast who's been let down by their latest flagship product, the SoundLink MAX. This premium speaker's glaring omission – the inability to link with other identical models – is a staggering misstep.As a loyal customer with decades of Bose electronics and speakers, I expected excellence from the SoundLink MAX. Its name suggests a continuation of Bose's legendary linking capability, allowing seamless stereo pairing with other compatible models. Instead, this pricey speaker stands alone, stubbornly refusing to connect with its own kind.The customer service department's baffling response – ""they had no idea why"" – only compounds my disappointment. Did Bose abandon their signature linking feature to cut costs or cater to a new market? Whatever the reason, it's a catastrophic decision.The SoundLink MAX's performance, while decent, can't justify its premium price tag. It lacks the depth and richness I've come to expect from Bose. Compared to its predecessors, this speaker feels like a step backward.*Key Issues:*1. No linking capability with other SoundLink MAX models2. Overpriced considering its limited features3. Disappointing sound quality compared to previous Bose models4. Lack of innovation and progress in design*Verdict:*Avoid the Bose SoundLink MAX. Its flawed design and missing feature make it a poor investment. As a loyal customer, I'm saddened by Bose's apparent self-destructive trajectory, prioritizing profit over innovation and customer satisfaction.*Rating:* 1.5/5 stars*Recommendation:*Explore alternative options from brands that still prioritize quality, innovation, and customer needs. Consider the following:- Sonos Move- JBL Boombox- UE MegablastBose, take heed: loyal customers expect better. Revisit your design philosophy and reclaim your reputation as a leader in audio excellence.*UPDATE:* I hope Bose will address this critical issue and release a firmware update or new model that restores the linking capability. Until then, I cannot recommend the SoundLink MAX.",https://www.amazon.com/Bose-SoundLink-Portable-Waterproof-Bluetooth/product-reviews/B0CVL1K7DX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1

I can live with the fact that it does not have a microphone for phone conversations but it's hard to get stereo with 2 speakers, 4 inches apart. You can get 2 flex speakers with microphones and pair up in stereo and separate them by thirty feet and have an amazing sound and only spend three hundred instead of four hundred. Returning it today.

The brushed rubber shell does collect fingerprints/stains but it just as easily sheds them with a swipe. This allows for a better grip. The front grill screams premium quality that you come to expect with the BOSE name. The included handle feels sturdy and makes you eager to try out the long shoulder strap that will truly make you portable and be able to carry hands free sound. The entire unit, about the size of a football, feels incredibly well made. It is heavy, dense, and very substantial. You would not be brushing it over, or knocking it off the table easily. Minor splashes in the kitchen setting while im preparing food have easily been cleaned off and leave no residual mark. The bluetooth connection is seemless and easily connects across multiple devices. The app allows for quick preset configurations such as treble boost that makes conversations in movies clear as day, while bass boost literally shakes your body with glorious vibrations. However, the reason to choose this product over the competitors is how loud it can get with the addition of BOSE famous clarity of sound. The loudness is similar to expensive alternatives that are much bigger in size. However the clarity and richness of BOSE is undeniable and incomparable. I filled my 3400 sq ft home with full sound and didn't even turn it up to the highest level for fear of disturbing my neighbor's peace. There was no rattle or crackle at that level which is the best mark of quality materials. My favorite setting to use is when I'm in the yard gardening and watering the plants. Once my shoulder strap arrives. I'm sure Ill just be able to carry it around as i work without having to reposition it at all. All in all, this is a premium device that you are paying for high quality materials and even higher quality sound. Bose did not disappoint!

The SoundLink Max is a small speaker that produces rich, full-bodied sound, making it stand out from other Bluetooth speakers. One of the most impressive aspects of the SoundLink Max is its deep, punchy bass response. The speaker's proprietary transducer technology delivers low frequencies with clarity, precision, and no distortion or muddiness.The SoundLink Max delivers a satisfying bass experience that belies its size, whether listening to hip-hop, electronic dance music, or rock. The midrange and treble frequencies are equally impressive, with a level of detail and clarity that is rare in portable Bluetooth speakers. Vocals sound natural and lifelike, while instruments are well-separated and easily distinguishable. The SoundLink Max is a musical time machine that transports you to the concert hall, putting you in the front row with the performers. Another standout feature of the SoundLink Max is its build quality.The speaker is constructed with high-quality materials, including a durable aluminum grille and a rubberized base that keeps it stable on any surface. It's ideal for use outdoors or in humid environments. It’s also water-resistant, perfect for summer pool parties or even on your boat. I love using it on my boat, as it is almost as loud as my built-in stereo. The long battery life ensures the music lasts all day, and because it is so small, my kids can carry it around and use it.The SoundLink Max is also incredibly easy to use, with simple controls and a user-friendly app that allows you to customize your listening experience. The speaker has a range of up to 30 feet, allowing you to move freely around your space without losing connection. Enjoy your music all day with up to 12 hours of battery life.

This review covers various aspects of the speaker, including sound quality, durability, ease of use, compatibility, setup, and design. The SoundLink Max lives up to the Bose name. After testing it with a myriad of musical genres, I was blown away by the fullness of the sound. The bass is so powerful that you can feel it, yet it does not drown out the mid and treble frequencies. It is worth noting that the initial EQ settings are flat, which might be why some users have complained about the lack of fullness. This could be addressed by repurposing the shortcut button for quick EQ adjustment. The SoundLink Max meets the IP67 standards, making it rugged, dustproof, and waterproof. Weighing nearly five pounds, it is heavy, but this is an acceptable trade-off for the durability it offers. In a pinch, you could even use it as a brick or a weapon for defending yourself from zombies! Using the SoundLink Max is straightforward. Press the power button, then play to start enjoying your music. When it’s time to change settings, the buttons are clearly labeled. The Max charges via a supplied USB-C cord and power block and can also serve as a portable power device. This is my main point of contention and it is not specifically with the Max, but with Bose as a whole. They have partnered with Qualcomm/Snapdragon for their HD Audio, which is currently confined to the Android ecosystem. As an iPhone user, I felt a little left out in the cold. Straight out-of-the-box, the Max was nearly ready to go. It took two seconds to pair and less than that to start charging, thanks to the included USB-C cable and power brick. The Bose app was easy to find and quick to install. I was able to set up an account and start using the app right away. While the setup was easy, more emphasis should be placed on the necessity of using the app to achieve the best sound, as the default EQ settings are a bit flat. The SoundLink Max boasts a sleek and simple design. There are no unnecessary lights or reminiscent designs to distract you—just a rugged exterior that protects the speakers while delivering excellent sound quality. The rope handle is a nice feature that accentuates the rugged yet simple design. They are easily changeable for other colored handles and shoulder straps, which are available at a steep premium on the Bose website. The Bose SoundLink Max is a phenomenal portable speaker that lives up to the high standards we expect from Bose. After several days of testing in various locations and with different music genres, I have not been disappointed. While there have been some reports of less-than-fantastic sound quality, this issue is easily resolved by adjusting the EQ settings in the Bose app. The final question is, is the SoundLink Max worth the $400 price tag? The simple answer is yes, it is worth every penny.",https://www.amazon.com/Bose-SoundLink-Portable-Waterproof-Bluetooth/product-reviews/B0CVL1K7DX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1

Where is the clarity and sound purity I worship from the Bose Revolve+ Series II? Even with a flat equalizer, the bass on this SoundLink Max sounds muddy compared to my prior Bose. But this ""muddy"" effect is common in portable speakers with bass, regardless of brand.After adjusting the equalizer on the Bose app, and listening to this Max for a few days, I have grown to enjoy its extra bass on pop and rock tracks that the Bose SoundLink Revolve+ Series II lacks. Now, if I had to switch from this SoundLink Max to my prior Bose, I would gripe, whine, moan, and complain:""Where is my bass? Where is the expanded soundstage coming from the side radiators on the Max? Where is the higher volume I can get out of the Max?""It has to do with acclimating to what we are used to. Now, if I had to choose only one of those two, it would likely be the Max. But I will always miss the sound purity out of the Revolve+ Series II.The Revolve+ Series II is as loud or louder than I usually desired. But if I were a young guy with no one telling me to ""Turn that noise pollution down!"", I would appreciate the extra volume and extra bass on this Bose SoundLink Max.GYMCADDY on YouTube said he likes the sound from the JBL Xtreme 4 better than from Bose SoundLink Max.The reason I chose this Bose SoundLink Max, is because the Xtreme 4 is a bit bigger, and the Max is already bigger than the Bose I replaced. And I need to balance a relatively compact mid size speaker, with sound quality and volume. The Extreme 4 is a bit bigger than what I am willing to schlepp around, manage, and find spots to nest it in during use and transport.If size were not an issue, I would have gotten the Extreme 4......except for ONE unfortunate factor:GYMCADDY said that - as of his review about a week ago - Extreme 4 needed a software update, as he experienced lip synch lag on it while watching videos on his phone, which he did not experience with the Max.The Max comes with a small rope handle, but you can purchase a long shoulder rope strap for it from Bose.Com for $45 + $5 shipping + sales tax. It is clever how you can use just one hand to turn each lug to remove the handle or shoulder strap, and easily replace with the other option. Each end of the rope and handles are permanently attached to its own lug loop, unless you use scissors or a knife to permanently detach them.Two benefits the Revolve+ Series II has that Bose SoundLink Max does not:1. You can use it for phone calls. 2. It is a circular speaker, you can set it in the middle of a room, and the sound comes out 360°: the sound is the same all the way around it. With the Max, you have to be in front of the speaker for its best sound.If you value clarity and simply amazing sound purity in a portable, get the Bose SoundLink Revolve+ Series II. It still has a modest amount of bass. If you want more pronounced bass, but need a relatively compact medium size portable, get this Max. If you desire even more volume, and don't mind carrying around and storing more weight and size, consider getting one of the bigger JBLs. But pause on the Xtreme 4, until they update their software for that video lip synch lag.JBL has an even bigger portable than Xtreme 4 that I use (an older version of) with my TV, on Bluetooth, and I experience no lip synch lag on it.P.S.: I am ""underwhelmed"" that Ama*on refused to sell me the third party brand protective carrying case with shoulder strap they label as their recommended choice, UNLESS I signed up for P*IME. I had never seen this before, though I do see other forms of manipulation on Ama*on.Such as frequently hiding the 'Most RECENT Review' option, so one has to go looking for the most recent review with some products, rather than seeing just the (usually) glowing 'Most Helpful Reviews' they place right in front of you. As a way to seduce you to click 'Buy It Now', rather than research what recent purchasers' experiences are with products.The reason they are called ""Managers"", is because ""Manipulators"" strips them na*ed in public. And public n*dity is ill eagle. Mmhm--that's how that works. Run and tell THAT.So I skipped the protective carrying case. I am glad I did, because except for the speaker grills, most of the rest of the speaker is rubberized, to minimize cosmetic damage. And a carrying case would also defeat my smaller, more portable speaker goal. And besides, if you use it as a ""portable"", carrying it to and fro, you reasonably expect it will get banged up to some degree.Educational Post Post Script: A box or container that delivers sound is called a ""speaker"". Each of the round things inside it that produce sound waves are called ""drivers"" or ""speaker drivers"". Better quality speakers have multiple drivers, such as for bass, midrange, and a tweeter for treble.",https://www.amazon.com/Bose-SoundLink-Portable-Waterproof-Bluetooth/product-reviews/B0CVL1K7DX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1
Unknown,R3EIPUGXWGBZM7,Positive,"NEW Bose SoundLink Max Portable Speaker, Large Waterproof Bluetooth Speaker, Up to 20 Hours of Battery Life, USB-C, Built-in 3.5mm AUX Input, Black",4.6,4.0,389,"INITIAL REVIEW...So my review is solely on the comparison of the sound between the Bose Soundlink Max vs. JBL Extreme 4.  Both are about the same prices.BASS:  Bose WINS.  Deeper and more prominent bass. (I realized it sounded bloated and muddy)TREBLE: JBL WINS.  More detailed and brighter.SPECTRUM OF SOUND:  Bose WINS.  Bose seems to have a wider spectrum of sound.SEPARATION OF INSTRUMENTS:  JBL WINS.SOUNDSTAGE:  JBL WINS.  JBL sounds more open while the Bose sounds more direct and focused.VOLUME:  Bose WINS.  Bose seems to get about 25% louder than the JBL. (But the JBL gets plenty loud -- the Bose get's ridiculously loud for its size)OVERALL SOUND ENJOYMENT:  This is tough but I belive the Bose WINS.  The Bose just sounded overall, better to me?  It definitely was warmer and less ""tinny"" sounding.  The brightness was apparent when you compare the two speakers.  I enjoy a V-shape sound.  I applied the EQ on both the Bose and JBL apps to reflect my preference.  Now don't get me wrong, if you only bought one and only listened to one speaker, you would probably think either one sounds phenomenal.CONSTRUCTION/MAKE:  Tie. This comes down to preference.VALUE:  This one is tough.  Just because you can buy a larger speaker, such as the Sony ULT 7 for the same price (on sale) as the JBL or Bose, doesnt mean the value is not there.  Because if you want a portable smaller speaker to bring, say, to the beach and  don't want to lug around a 15 lbs speaker, then you have to compare the smaller speakers and see which one provides the best sound and features for the smaller size.  Overall, I believe the JBL and Bose should be more realistically priced at $300 regular price - not $400.  But for the smaller size footprint, these two speakers are pretty amazing.UPDATED ON 09.23.24:After keeping the Bose for a few days, I purchased the JBL Extreme 4 to listen to it again.

Did a bunch of research and came up with two speakers. Extreme 4 and Bose SoundLink Max. Bought the extreme 4, got it home and listened to it for 2 days. While the sound was very surprising for such a small speaker and had a lot of bass the upper end was just too harsh for me. So I boxed it up to go back and ordered the  Bose SoundLink Max. While the base was just about the same with both speakers the mid and upper range to my ear was so much more mellow on the Bose. As One reviewer put it, the extreme 4 is an outdoor party speaker in the Bose some link Max is an indoor speaker. Both are excellent products.

Internet, Netflix, Amazon prime. Home screen sucks. My old tv connected to the security cameras as soon as it turned on, then I could go to the home screen if I wanted.

So, it is a boat anchor as far as I'm concerned, though it would probably float, to me it is unbelievablely light. I would send back, but it was my own fault for not checking first and buying because it was cheap. I will be buying another tv to take its place, after some research, and this will be only for the security cameras and left on until it burns out considering it only has 2 HDMI connections anyways. If it would go to the thing connected to it first, I might have replaced the monitor for my laptop with it.Update: I was able to find a setting that makes it go to the last imput when turning on, as long as I check the cameras before I shut it off, it seems to work fine. The headphones disconnecting is happening more often, like when I go to an app I have to reconnect, but not positive yet if that is what is causing it. Once on Netflix it stays connected, though I have to go into the settings to connect manually. The speakers sound bad, low volume, but I haven't changed any of the settings since I bought it exclusively to be heard through headphones.

Of course when my four year old is watching TV, he sort of stares blankly at the TV while unconsciously picking at the buttons.  He just loves that rubbery feel, I guess.So it's partly my fault for having a destructive trait in my DNA, partly just whatever, and partly the remote's fault.  So after reprimanding my son, I ordered two more (They're SO cheap).  Anyway, sure enough, without fail, my floor was littered with the tiny little rubber buttons after a day or so.Other that this issue, they work fine, just as they are supposed to.  I can put the buttons back in, but it's kinda stupid to keep doing that.As you were",https://www.amazon.com/Replaced-Control-Compatible-Westinghouse-Insignia/product-reviews/B09Z6Q2MLC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1

They didn't sound like open-ear headphones at all.• Light - I barely felt them on my ears, I tested them for 5+ hours and they didn't bother my ears like others (Airpods/Pro's) do.•Cons:• Price - Not worth $300. With connection issues and lacking features such as auto pause/play when putting them on and taking them off, clunky volume adjustments.• Connectivity - Each time I put them on, it took a few tries for them to recognize they should be synced and playing music together. Most of the time I had one playing music, then the other wouldn't ever catch up. So I had to put them back in their case and start over.• Battery Life Indicator - You'll NEVER know the actual battery life of the case. You can look in the manual to see what the colored lights mean, but those are just an approximation. Unless they do some an update, there was no way to tell the case battery life. I believe they speak the battery % when you first put the headphones on, I'm not 100% sure about that.I REALLY wanted to love these, and I did, but I couldn't justify the cost for what I was getting. First off, the sound quality was excellent. These were my first Bose headphones, and I expected the sound quality to be subpar, (I've used other open-ear headphones, 3 versions of SHOKZ) being they're open-ear, but the sound was the BEST thing about these. I tested the ""spatial/immersive audio,"" it was trippy at first - cool use of technology, but I don't think I'd ever need/want that. I continued playing around in the app for a bit to learn the features and the button presses, which aren't inherent, so you'll have to look them up to find out what they are. More times than not, I would have connection issues. I'd put them on and they wouldn't sync together and play music, only one would be playing. I had to fully remove both of them, drop them in the case, and start over to get them to work again, or open the app, disconnect them, and reconnect them. It was a hassle and shouldn't be happening with a $300 product, especially from Bose. Also, the audio would intermittently pop or disconnect for a second on one or both of the earbuds. I don't feel like a $300 product should be doing this.That said, if these earbuds were in the $200 range, I would've considered keeping them. I think they're an excellent proof-of-concept product, but they still need more refinements to be charging $300 for them.",https://www.amazon.com/Bose-Immersive-Wireless-OpenAudio-Awareness/product-reviews/B0CPFV77W4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1

Somebody at Bose has a brain that's too big for their skull, because these are a truly incredible concept... That almost work.It was very obvious from the time that I played the first song that something wasn't quite right with the sound quality. Going in, I thought the bass was going to be an issue because that was a topic that came up in a lot of the reviews I read. The bass was pretty good, but the range a snare sits in (not a audio tech) was really really bad. The sound is just overall lacking a wholeness and life that in the ear headphones just don't have an issue with. I don't know if this is an issue with the headphones though, as it might just be an inhering flaw with with this style. I would say it feels like Bose really knocked it out of the park with the engineer and design here, but the ceiling for sound quality here is too low for them to be excellent.I think I didn't pay enough attention to the reviews that essitially said ""for $300, no,"" because that's pretty much the conclusion I came to after less than an hour.It's tough, because the incredible engineering and design behind them make me want to like it, but ultimately I don't think I could ever enjoy my music with these.A side note: people can hear what you're listening to while you have these in, which I don't think I saw anyone talk about. If you're thinking of also using these in like a quite office setting, do not get this. Unless you don't like your coworkers... Then these might be a good investment.

This design is perfect for those who want to stay connected to the world without sacrificing their listening experience. The sound quality is clear and balanced, providing a premium audio experience, especially in quieter settings. Additionally, the open-ear format avoids the discomfort of traditional earbuds, making them a great option for those who find in-ear buds to be intrusive.However, there are a few areas for improvement. The ""one size fits all"" design doesn’t work well for everyone, particularly for those with larger ears. Many users report difficulty in achieving a comfortable fit, often experiencing pinching and discomfort, especially during extended use. Bose has acknowledged this issue, but it remains a concern for potential buyers. Furthermore, while the sound quality is excellent in quiet environments, the audio volume can feel insufficient in outdoor or noisy settings, making it hard to fully enjoy your music. Another drawback is that the battery drain is inconsistent between the two earbuds, with one often depleting faster than the other when both are used simultaneously.Overall, the Bose Ultra Open Earbuds excel in delivering high-quality sound with an innovative design, but they may not be the best fit for those with larger ears or for use in louder environments.",https://www.amazon.com/Bose-Immersive-Wireless-OpenAudio-Awareness/product-reviews/B0CPFV77W4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1

I think they look awesomeThe cons...- Case feels pretty cheap/loose, especially for the price- Mics aren't great. They seem to go in and out on calls. May be due to my defective unit- Could be louder, but honestly not a requirement- Durability/quality control/warranty (read below)I'm knocking them down 3 stars because after a few months of use, I started to run into issues charging them, and audio in the right bud will simply stop working for hours at a time. No combination of factory reset/repairing helps. After talking to support they agreed to send me a warranty replacement, but they don't do advanced replacements, so i need to send these in first. They also told me that due to warranty centers moving (or maintenance?), it may take up to 8-10 weeks after they receive the buds before I receive the replacements.I'll likely give the Soundcore C30i's a shot since i'll be without this style of headphones for a while and can't afford to drop another 299 for another pair. If i could go back, i would probably have simply got the Soundcore's. I knew 299 was steep, but assumed there would be a good warranty process in place. Only myself to blame.

The concept is great! Very comfortable! The problem is that everyone can hear whatever it is you’re listening to, which means they can hear your phone calls as well.The video that Bose uses to give you an idea of sound leakage is not accurate. If you are about 50%, in volume, others can hear. 30% will give leakage, just not as bad but it would be enough to irritate those around you. If you tend to listen to music or whatever at the 30 to 50% level, this is not for you. Depending on the movie you may be watching, you may have to turn up the volume for that movie, which will give sound leakage.These cannot be used in a library but a louder setting, like if you were in a dining hall or where there is outside noise that the sound leakage would be fine, walking to the train!I will say this, if you are not concerned with sound leakage or other’s listening to your calls, these are for you. The sound is incredible! But, I will say that the over the ear canal may be better. I am checking out the Lenovo erazer.I do see others that are similar to these, where they rest over the ear canal.

They're that bad! Bose always seems to come up short in the call quality in the microphone for some reason in earbuds. You sound like you are talking in a tunnel, idk I am going to wait for the gen 2 or until Bose decides to stop buying microphones from the dollar store.Battery:Not much to say besides it depends on if you use both ears and you will get 8 hrs if you use one ear at a time then you can extend the battery even longer.Comfort:These are comfortable for the most part but there is a snug feeling to them that you have to get a custom to.

These are very much “one size fits all” earbuds - so I think the experience will vary from person to person.  For all the reviews saying “you’ll forget you have them on”, I found the exact opposite to be true. I think these have so much potential - I love the idea of open earbuds, I give Bose credit for the innovative design, but as of now these are, in my opinion, objectively bad for running.",https://www.amazon.com/Bose-Immersive-Wireless-OpenAudio-Awareness/product-reviews/B0CPFV77W4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1
Unknown,R33VK17OX89OQC,Positive,"Bose Ultra Open Earbuds, Immersive Audio Open Ear Earbuds, Clip on Earbuds for Comfort, Running Earbuds with OpenAudio for Awareness, Up to 48 Hours of Battery Life, Black",3.9,5.0,"2,070","Usually I say they are good for what it’s worth.  In this case, for what I paid for them, they are not worth it.Pro’s:  the ear clip/cuff design is different and good, the fit is pretty secure and won’t fall off, comfortable, immersive sound is a plus, turning off the immersive sound and they last  longer between charges.  When running I hardly noticed I had them on my ears.  The sound was good when I was running.  I noticed as I was running that the music got louder.  I think it was because they settled onto my ear lobes and also I turned the automatic volume control.Cons: too expensive, can’t adjust to being closer to ear canal, left me wanting and expecting more from the ear cuff buds.  They seem limited when turning them up to 7 or 8 on the flat setting.  Should be priced around the sound core and shokz open fit buds price, maybe even pricing them lower like $125-$150 on the high end.  For $300 they should have wireless charging, multi point connectivity.  Most of all a larger and louder volume level.  I’m returning them.  My aftershockz aeropex bone conduction headphones do a better job and lasts my whole 10 hour workday without needing to be charged.Maybe another software update with automatic multipoint switching, adjust the eq curve to have more low end and not cap the bass when playing at a higher volume, and drop the price and they would an awesome product.Update 3/12/2024So I returned my first pair of ultra earbuds, and got a set of Shokz open fit earbuds.  I tried those on for some time and really like how they performed overall.  But somehow I started to miss the bose earbuds, and wanted to compare how they went up against the Shokz offering.  The price is still steep, but I had an amazon gift card balance of $157 so I went ahead and bought the Bose to do the comparison.The fit was excellent as before, the sound is excellent, I registered them to get the two year nose warranty as I can see these being replaced sometime in September the future.  The Shokz are really good and probably rank them as one of the best hook buds in the market.  For me and my ears, the Bose and the Shokz are an excellent buy.  They both are light and fitment is excellent, the sound is superb, the call quality I give to Shokz, the update happened to both and somehow the call quality on the bose really improved.  I still prefer the physical button over the touch sensitive approach that Shokz went with.  I still like the Bose ear cuff design vs the earhook.  So which do I prefer.  Running and exercising-Bose without a doubt, mountain biking and any sport with a lot of wind noise-Shokz hands down.3/19/2024I started noticing the Bose ultra open buds starting to lose connection when putting them on.  The right ear would get the connected prompts, but the left would not connect and when it does connect, it loses drops connection a couple of time more than connects and syncs up with the right ear.  I’m going to request for a replacement pair.  Overall, these are excellent buys if you have a gift card balance to buy down these buds.  The Shokz were on sale so I returned my black pair and got the white pair.  I had some Amazon credits and used those credits to buy the Shokz at much lower price.3/29/2024Bose pushed an update to the open ultras (version 1.10.4).  The audio sounded clearer, the connection issue seems to have been resolved, I noticed while doing yard work that my Bose lasted approximately 5 hours on the immersion setting.  No multipoint connectivity like the Shokz open fits have.  Also,  I saw that Bose released a wireless charging case on their website for $50.  I decided to not get the wireless charging case because I was already used to the usb-c plug approach.",https://www.amazon.com/Bose-Immersive-Wireless-OpenAudio-Awareness/product-reviews/B0CPFV77W4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1

I am *not* one for fashion. Black T-shirt and olive shorts is my daily ""uniform"". It is interesting, and surprising, that many people thought that these ear buds were a fashion statement. Not me.Now on to the actual good stuff. Compared to the Shokz OpenRun Pro, these Bose ear buds are expensive. Oh, yeah, no denying that. However, at the same time the fit, comfort, and sound quality are also much better, at least for me.I wear glasses, the OpenRun Pro will fit, but there is always the constant adjustment because both the OpenRun Pro and the glasses want to rest on the same place. The Bose Ultra Open does not interfere, at all. The Bose Ultra Open earbuds are more comfortable and convenient.In terms of sound quality, there is no comparison. When I first got the OpenRun Pro, it was a vast improvement over the much older Shokz. The Bose Ultra Open earbuds are something else. One problem that I had with the OpenRun Pro is the placement of the sound emitters. A very slight shift in position caused left-right imbalance. The Ultra Open earbuds do not have this issue, at least on my ears. Also, at higher volumes, the OpenRun Pro had some scratching sounds, probably because the transducers were mechanically rubbing or contacting the casing.In comparison, the *one* thing that the OpenRun Pro is superior is battery life. I can wear it all day, and it does not run out of battery. The Ultra Open earbuds, however, will need a little charging break during the day. However, carrying the case with me makes a quick recharge a breeze.How good is the sound? I am no HiFi aficionado, and definitely not a purist. I can say this: in a quiet office, I now prefer the Ultra Open to a pair of wired IEMs that connect to a dedicated amp. I did not even have to tweak the equalizer in the Bose app.For an open earbud that just hangs on to the ear lobes, the Ultra Open is impressive in terms of sound quality and battery life.",https://www.amazon.com/Bose-Immersive-Wireless-OpenAudio-Awareness/product-reviews/B0CPFV77W4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1

I wanted to try something that didn’t go in to my ear at all and these looked enticing. I held off for a while because I saw the reviews about them not being loud enough at times and it made me nervous. I also didn’t want them in white or black.  When the blue color came out, I decided to give them a try.Most of the time, I’m very happy with them. They are extremely comfortable and the fit is exactly what I was hoping for. When I’m listening to audio books at home, I have no problems with the volume. The battery life is excellent and they charge quickly.There are 3 things that are keeping me from loving them. For whatever reason, phone volume is completely different from listening volume. I can be listening to a book or music and have the volume at 75% and hear perfectly. Then, someone will call and I will turn the volume up to 100% and still not be able to hear them very well. I have also found that people on the phone have a hard time hearing me too.The third thing that I do not like is that they don’t have ear sensors that tell them when the earbud is in your ear. I have two other sets of earbuds that detect when they’re in the ear and then they connect to the phone. I didn’t realize how much I liked this feature until I didn’t have it. This is annoying when the earbud accidentally gets knocked out of my ear and my book continues to play whereas with my other earbuds, it would stop when it sensed it wasn’t in my ear anymore. I have also had some problems with connectivity that have caused me to have to completely forget my phone and the earbuds and reset the connection.Overall, I am pretty happy with these earbuds, but there are a few things that are keeping me from using them exclusively and putting all of my other pairs aside",https://www.amazon.com/Bose-Immersive-Wireless-OpenAudio-Awareness/product-reviews/B0CPFV77W4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1

I finally decided to see if there was a better solution and stumbled upon these Bose Ultra Open Earbuds, which seemed like they could be the answer.After about a week or so of using them, I have been pleasantly surprised at how well they perform. They are by far the weirdest pair of earbuds I have ever owned, and I was considering buying the Sony LinkBuds but I was really hoping for something different like bone conduction rather than in the ear (which seem to be my main problem).I also was hoping that I'd be able to wear them for longer than my in-ear pair, which definitely is the case. Comparatively I'd have to take my in-ears out every so often to clean my ears as with these the only issue is my ear tends to get a tad irritated after long-use but it also could just be my ears getting used to something being there, hard to say right now until I've had them for longer but I just adjust them slightly up or down when I feel discomfort.I actually got these as my ""gaming"" earbuds, which after turning off ""Immersion Mode"" and using ""Stereo Mode"" I feel it's best unless you're listening to music it's just too bassy for regular stuff in my humble opinion (still sounds great, YMMV). Battery life has been a lot better than my other pair of earbuds which would die after ~4-6 hours, so far the lowest I've gotten these have been around 40%. I'm also not too sure how fast they charge, since they live on my desk and I charge them overnight but when I first charged them it took about half hour to fully charge from ~60%.It's a bit difficult to figure out what the optimal spot is for these earbuds to perform their best, I believe for me at least when they're at their lowest on/in your ear it seems to be the best. I'll randomly check that they're evenly pushed into my ears and not falling out from time to time, but generally they're pretty snug fit that don't move much once on.As far as ""noise cancellation"" or ""passive hearing"" goes, they do a pretty good job at blocking out sound when turned up I generally have mine around 60% at that's loud enough for me - I can still hear around me, if need be which I like not having to take off my earbuds in between sessions to multitask. There was a recent firmware update that adds auto-volume, which increases the volume in louder environments which is kind of ""noise cancellation"" in its simplest form. You're also able to control the earbuds pretty well with just the button on either earbud, play, pause, skip track, reverse track, toggle immersive mode or you can customize the shortcut which is nice. I have left as cycle thru still/motion/off immersion, and right as toggle immersion but there's also ""switch devices"" and ""access your voice assistant"" as options.I look forward to future updates and possibly v2 of this product if it performs well, a great niche product for an oversaturated market. I would recommend trying these out if you're at all interested, the price is a bit hard to swallow but they may become your favorite pair of earbuds 🫠",https://www.amazon.com/Bose-Immersive-Wireless-OpenAudio-Awareness/product-reviews/B0CPFV77W4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1

The only things in the box were the earbuds, the case, and a USB-A to USB-C cable. The case feels premium, along the line of other cases I have from other premium earbuds. The case feels comfortable to hold, easy to carry in my pocket. What stands out to me with the case is the lights, I’m not exactly sure why, but when you place the buds in the case and the lights are lit up I really like how that looks. I also like there were no ear tips included, there were none of those here. No fitting the different ear tips then unsure if I have the right ones selected.I was not used to just setting something into my ear and not worrying trying to completely seal up my ear canal. Once I got used to setting these in my ears, it was well worth it. I really didn’t even feel them on my ear. No feeling the pressure that builds up with a sealed ear canal, no popping them out to hear someone talking to me, no uncomfortable feelings at all. According to the website it shows most people wearing them high up on their ears, but for me they fit, feel and sound better down lower on my ears. You just set the earbud into your ear, wrap the elastic part around the bottom of my ear and away you go. I enjoy the best of both worlds, I have my music or my audio books with me wherever I want to go without worrying about the what I cannot hear while crossing the parking lot. I wear these in the park for my morning walk, and don’t get that paranoid feeling that someone is walking up behind me like I do with noise cancelling ear sealing headphones. I can still hear the important things going on around me.The sound is fantastic! I really like music on these. The charge lasts a good portion of the day, I haven’t had any problems yet with them running out of battery. They’re IPX4 rated, so I’m not worried about wearing them while I work out. And I’m surely not worried about having them fall out, I tried my best and couldn’t shake them out. They’re not multi-point capable yet, supposed to come as a software update. But I’m happy with that, I have had enough run ins where I’m listening to a book on my phone then start playing a game on my tablet and having to fight to make sure the sound is coming from the device I want it to come from.Overall these are great earbuds, flew right to the top of my list and are my favorite now. And I have the top of the line earbuds from several different manufacturers.

I had gotten a less expensive pair of open ear buds on Amazon that were hella comfortable and had a good mic, but the sound quality, volume, and connectivity reliability were unsat, so I reluctantly spent some money; so far no regrets. Not even one letter. 🤭LIKES | Comfortable to wear // allows ambient noise // sound quality is way better than some reviews would have you think - the quality is what you’d expect from Bose and for the higher price tag // volume performs sufficiently in most of my circumstances (e.g. vs a leaf blower = no; vs traffic = most of the time yes; vs F-35 conducting flights overhead = no; vs chatter and the beach = yes) …these are open ear, there is going to be some interference // safety because I can hear what’s going on around me // they stay on during cardio // one charge lasts me at least a week, but I haven’t let them die yet so uncertain how long a charge actually lasts - I do not use them for hours and hours though // calls are clear on both ends // quality, removable skins can be found on Amazon if you’d like to customize them a bit, and there are protective cases for attaching them to bags and whatnot.DISLIKES: I have had these for a couple of months now, and while they were easy to set up and get to know, there was one day when they lost BT connectivity and then wouldn’t show up on the device list (this is the -.5 star): I restarted my phone and reconnected with BT and there have been no issues since (a few days ago) // comfort-wise, these may take some getting used to: they are not uncomfortable but I did have to find that sweet spot on my ears // if you are waving your arms like a maniac, you may easily knock them off - or in my case, putting on a sun hat, which is easily rectified by putting the hat on first… I know, I know… they stay on pretty well while running, but I would not wear them on a rollercoaster.I will update back to 5 stars at some point if there are no further connectivity issues.

They did a perfect job at that, the fit felt loose enough to where it didn’t feel like much was there but secure enough to where i was pretty sure they wouldn’t fall off. If they’re placed right, they sound amazing, and while small movement can sometimes cause fairly big changes, most comfortable positions should lead to good sound quality. Last, it seems Bose may be slightly underselling the battery life on these, I can listen through an entire work day without taking them out once and still find them to have 30 percent remainingThese earbuds aren’t without their cons, however. The charging case, while having strong magnets to hold the buds in place, otherwise feels very flimsy, especially at the hinge which has a fair bit of play, something that should definitely be improved at this price point. Additionally, there is a persisting connection issue i’ve had where the two earbuds will fall in and out of sync with each other for a few minutes, with no way to fix it other than waiting it out.

While they do allow you to concentrate on the sound, sometimes people are talking to you and you don’t hear them and then you end up being in your office when the CEO gives an impromptu speech and everyone in the office leaves their desk except you, because you’re in the zone with the noise cancelling headphones in. Then you look around and notice everyone in your office is standing around the CEO except you and you have to awkwardly take out your noise cancelling headphones and look over from your desk because otherwise it’d be too obvious that you weren’t on the same planet when he came in the room and started talking.

I'm someone who loves to listen to music, and had been looking for some new headphones that would accompany a pair of Monster - Inspirations I've had for the past 10 years that are still going strong. Monster, you might remember, was the first company to produce Beats before they were bought by Apple. The Solo3's were PERFECT. I know they're not the most ""Audiophile"" pair of cans on the planet, but even Sennheiser's HD 800's need some sort of DAC to make them less...Flat sounding. And hey, if you like Flat and consider yourself a true audiophile...well first, I don't know why you'd be reading a review for Beats Studio Pro, and second, I mean good for you, listening to music like it was a 1920's Phonograph.Me, I personally favor boosted everything. Bass, Mids, Highs. And the Solo 3's were, hell, still are, amazing. No full DAC required. Everytime I plug in the 3.5mm cable and listen to Lossless audio on my home server, Gosh, I mean...they sound good streaming 320kbps AAC/MP3's over bluetooth, which is what MOST OF YOU will use them for, but LOSSLESS!? It makes me wet. I'm sorry.So enter the Studio Pro's. Got these for $169 on Prime Day. Busted these babies out, put them in AAANNND...boy, they are not like the Solo3's at all. I mean, connected via Bluetooth is fine. It's fine. They're fine. Any $75 dollar headset will perform well enough over bluetooth and give you comparable noise cancelling if you're looking for that.  But these, at retail NOT ON SALE, are like $350...I expect MORE from that. The other reviews gushing about these led me to believe I'd be getting MORE from that. And, again, they're fine. It's fine. But not GREAT. And for $350 I expect them to be great. For $170 I expected them to be BETTER, and they just weren't. And that's just bluetooth...when I plugged them in via the USB-C cable AND the 3.5mm jack for lossless audio...boy the performance was not there. They were so much quieter than the Solo's, and nothing was as Punchy. In fact, they sounded kind of flat. But if I wanted flat, I'd get the Sennheiser's and like a $600 DAC or other sound mix board to plug directly into. And you know, I have a DAC. It's the $65 dollar Fiio BTR3K, which is actually a very nice portable device I've used with my Solo3's and in my car to get lossless audio in my car. It performs well for what it is. So I plugged the Studio Pro's into it and they instantly sounded superior. And, y'know, I probably wouldn't mind that at all if I was listening to music 8 hours a day through the DAC and with the headphones firmly on. But I'm not, at least not enough to justify even the heavily discounted price I paid. And even with the Dac and settings, they still weren't as punchy. The Solo3's...I don't know, everytime I listen to lossless, it feels like I'm in the studio with the band, but with the Studio Pros, it feels like I'm listening to an MP3 on an iPod from 2008. That you downloaded. From Limewire. I mean, again, it's FINE, they're FINE. But shouldn't we be expecting more than FINE? Maybe it's time to bite the bullet and just invest in a Pair of the Sony XM5's or, yes, the Sennheiser HD600's or 700's or 800's with a beefy Desktop DAC if I want to increase my experience.But these...these ain't it.

I'm Samsung all the way. Anyways I went ahead and ordered the skullcandy and 2 I just got those today and they in my opinion are far superior and will run you over 100.00 less. So if you want headphones with bass go with skull candy. Beats just don't have the bass.,https://www.amazon.com/Beats-Studio-Pro-Kardashian-Compatibility/product-reviews/B0D94YRL99/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1

My priority was noise-cancelling, as I am sensitive to all types of unwanted sounds, like someone talking on the phone at the office, or construction noises in the building, etc. I have had Sony, and I had no problem with noise cancellation. It was super cool, I could just turn off my nerves and work, live, move, do sports, etc. Beats has waaaay worse noise-cancellation, in the background in all modes I still hear what is going on around.The only things that is better comparing to Sony, is the stronger construction, for gym it is a plus.All other options Beats is worse. Sony is a winner.It is also a discomfort while switching between connected devices, take several some time till the headphone understands that it has to play on another device.Anyway, if I had to buy this at its original price, I would not do that. Not worth it.If I was an iPhone user, I would take AirPods Max, if no compatibility issue, I would still take it.So, if ANC is important for you, here is the list of winners:1. Apple AirPods Max2.

Then I graduated to the wireless Beats Studios, as well as the Executive headphones and those were my headphones for years. I don’t recall the noise cancelling being anything at all and of course there was no such thing as a transparency mode back then, but at the time I loved the look, the colors (especially metallic gold of the Beats Studios) and enjoyed the heavy bass sound they provided. As I grew more sophisticated and appreciated more sound quality, I moved on to other headphones (plus my last pair of Beats Studio the hinge broke on one side). I had tried the Beats Solo Pros and wanted to love them but they were, though improved, still an on-ear headphone and too uncomfortable for me. I had hoped then that an update for the Studios to Studio Pros was imminent but turned out it would be awhile before this did come to pass but I knew once it did I would have to buy them and try them out eventually. It didn’t take long as I saw they went on sale for $100 off only a month after release and I jumped on that deal! I am pleasantly impressed for the most part. They do a lot of the same things as the AirPods Max, if not as well. Sound quality is really good and has a more neutral sound than previous Beats Studios did. The Dolby Atmos with head tracking is fun. They are a little bright sounding and I sometimes have to either turn down the volume or use the eq on the iPhone Music App to lower the treble, or turn off the Spatial Stereo feature in the control center, (long press on the volume slider) but overall I find the sound pleasant and lively. There are no wear sensors, but I love the old school B buttons for pausing, volume and skipping and rewinding tracks very easy and intuitive after using Beats Studios for years so I don’t really miss it that much frankly. They are fairly comfortable, the cushioning on the ear pads and headband are plush but they do have a strong clamping force which might bother some but doesn’t bother me overly much, and I am fan of how stable they feel on my head. Noise canceling is quite good but as is expected not at AirPods Max level. I’ve always loved the 5 LED lights on the bottoms of the right ear cup which will show you the battery level when pressed. A double press of this button will switch between ANC and Transparency. Long press for Bluetooth pairing. No auto-switching between devices but once connected to a device in your iCloud, they automatically show up in other devices in the cloud and a press within the Bluetooth’s settings will switch it to the other device quickly and easily. The headphones will announce messages and you have the ability to use “Hey, Siri’ but I’ve noticed sometimes audio will stop with an announcement or Siri activation and may not continue playing music on its own, but a simple press of the “B” button will start play again. On the AirPods Max audio will reduce significantly but not stop, but with these the sound stops abruptly which can be jarring at first when the announcement is made. Of course you can turn off announcements in the control center if you want to avoid the interruption altogether. Build quality is plastic but still solid with metal sliders that have a jarring but somehow pleasing click as you slide them in or out. They are also very light, certainly lighter than the AirPods Max (which I also own). Also the case is nice with a spot for cables and even another pouch inside on the other side if you need it, but can’t really imagine adding much as with the headphones in, there really isn’t a lot of room. If you can get these on sale especially I would recommend then as a less pricey alternative to the more expensive headphones like the AirPods Max. I’m a fan of the sandstone color, I hear the dark colors, especially black, are finger smear magnets. These are a little bit like that, but with the light color it is much less of an issue. These are a classic revisited and I will always have a soft spot for the Beats Studio (now pros) headphones! I forgot to mention that you can use the usb c cable for lossless audio from your computer or iPad, which is awesome, although i have yet to try that out as I am all about wireless functionality, I don’t like being tied down to wires! Still great option, and one the AirPods Max cannot do (yet anyway). These are a great option for those not willing or able to spend more and still great a great headphone!",https://www.amazon.com/Beats-Studio-Pro-Kardashian-Compatibility/product-reviews/B0D94YRL99/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1

However, one complaint I have with the Beats and Beats Studio 3 is the ear pain after wearing them for several hours due to the uncomfy earpads. That said, this Studio Pro is so comfy on my head/ears and I don't feel uncomfortable at all! This model also feels lighter than the Studio 3s.The sound quality is super crisp, though no noticeable differences between it and ANC noise cancellation on the Studio 3. Apparently, the 3.5mm aux cord is supposed to enhance sound quality, but I don't know how much more you can -- the wireless version is already amazing. I work from home and am constantly in calls. One reason I bought the Studio Pros is for its state-of-the-art background noise filter on calls. I've given these a test drive on a workday and they work like a dream. Now I can talk to clients without worrying whether they'll hear my neighbor shouting at his dogs or mowing his lawn.Design-wise, the color is beautiful. I am not a fan of the Kardashians, but I absolutely love the stylish case and cords that came with the Kim K's! I am also impressed at the long battery life, which is twice as long as the Studio 3's.I think the original price is ridiculous (an extra $100 for certain colors just because they're ""Kim K?"" They'd better be able to make my dinner and clean my house!) but I'm glad I snagged these for almost half off during the Prime Day sale.

I’m talking monster cable beats. Nothing was cooler, the bass was thundering, and while it didn’t sound great, it sounded so much better than the iPod in ears or my dad’s old crappy walkman on-ears I was used to. I listen to mostly electronic music, bass/dubstep, house & techno, all of that with some hip/hop and pop sprinkled in as well. I also love movies.As an adult at home, I have my beyerdynamic dt 770 pros for mixing and editing with. I have a pair of AirPods Pro 2s for travel and day to day usage. Recently, I have started to work from home a lot more in meetings, and there has been a lot of construction outside my window, and I hate having things stuck in my ears for hours on end so I was in the market for a pair of noise canceling over ear headphones.My partner has a pair of AirPods Max, I found the sound to be really great, detailed with good sound stage and flat great for voice but clinical and safe in all respects and lacking the bass I was looking for. Even with the top-of-the-pack anc and apple integration features I was used to on my in-ears I never could swallow the price. Also they were comfortable, but so heavy and not suited for long periods of wear. And the case was weird.So I tried the bereydynamic lagoon ANCs. They were garbage. Impossible to use the controls and pair with devices, sounded really good but not as good as I would expect from this brand, and the issues go on and on. They did have good bass, but the anc barely worked. I liked them at a lot at first, but they fell apart so quickly.Then I saw that apple had brand new beats headphones, and were 30% off on Amazon. I had to try them, the nostalgia hit hard and I’m so happy they didn’t change the iconic design from the studio 2s which I also liked as a replacement for my solos. I. Am. Floored. Super lightweight yet feel very solid and no creaking, apple integration features (i consider no auto switching to be a plus tbh, but icloud pairing is a must. Works very well with Apple TV), but the sound! Is so FUN. It’s like I’m in a concert hall with huge racks of speakers and towers of subwoofers. So much better than my old beats, by a landslide. Great instrument separation, and decent soundstage, sounds less like a wall of sound like my pro 2s do but not as wide and spatial as the max. A little bright for my taste, but never enough to cause fatigue. None of them come close to the 770s of course - would I recommend these for classical? Or acoustic? Never. Or for any type actual professional work? No. But if you like electronic, you will have so much fun enjoying music with these. The ANC and transparency is very very good, identical to my AirPods Pro, I would argue maybe even better than the max in some situations. The mic quality is good, not as good as my AirPods but good enough for work calls. I also love watching movies, and having multi-channel support like my pro 2s is epic.

My headphones came out of the box with about 56% battery and though I just received them yesterday, after a good amount of use so far I haven't had to charge them yet, and probably won't have to for about a week.- Noise cancellation is excellent for my expectations/standards. I've read reviews saying they're not that great; I say if you're super-duper picky about this, and you're looking for absolutely NO outside sound at ALL, then yeah, maybe these aren't for you. I don't listen to music or audio very loud as I have sensitive hearing, so with noise cancellation active I can still hear small/faint muffled sounds in my surroundings (with audio paused/turned off): someone vacuuming, a thud from someone dropping something heavy upstairs, group laughter or yelling (if it's nearby). But overall, the ANC is certainly very good. With audio playing I really can't hear any of these things, except a faint hum of a very loud machine or my fiance, if he's next to me (he has a loud voice), but even then his voice is muffled and I can't make out every word unless he's yelling or shrieking.- Love transparency mode. Perfect blend of audio + surroundings.Cons:- While headband is cushioned and fairly comfortable for a short period of time, I do begin to feel a small ache at the top of my head after about 30 minutes of use. I have a small head, so I can adjust the headband slightly forward or back to remedy this, but I do find myself having to shift them every 20 to 30 minutes due to slight discomfort.- I'm not sure if this is something standard or not, but when plugged in to my computer with the basic audio cable, I cannot use the left ear controls to pause or adjust the audio volume; they only work in wireless/Bluetooth mode, or with the USB-C cable. The right ear transparency/noise cancellation mode button, however, does work regardless of how you're listening (wired or wireless).Overall I really like these headphones, and I'm happy I purchased them for the $169 sale price via Prime Day. I expect to get a lot of use out of them, and hope they'll last me several years as a reliable pair of quality headphones.

I bought these Beats over the ear headphones in the color DUNE, primarily because I needed supplemental headphones beyond my airpods that I can workout in without worrying they’ll fall out and because I wanted a light brown color to match my skin and wardrobe. These headphones fit the bill perfectly. If I were darker skinned I would’ve gotten the EARTH color which is a gorgeous chocolate brown. Kim didn’t miss with these color schemes.I did not buy these for the noise-canceling effect but can testify that the noise canceling works so well that I was the last person off the amtrak train and the conductor had to wake me up because I was sleeping and did not hear the intercom system while these headphones were on. I only had the volume at about 45% and am not a heavy sleeper. They also were a breeze to connect to my iPhone. Super simple bluetooth integration.These headphones get plenty loud and I adjusted my Spotify EQ settings to bass booster so that I could get that bass effect. It’s true there is no real bass with the headphones without adjusting the equalizer settings first. But once I adjusted, the bass was plenty for me.

Because everyone deserves to experience this level of audio bliss!Let’s talk about the battery life—chef’s kiss! I’ve got 18-hour days, and my Beats are right there with me from dawn to way past dusk, never missing a beat (pun totally intended). Whether I'm blasting music while working or zoning out with an audiobook, these bad boys keep going. And let me tell you, the sound quality is so crystal clear, I can practically hear which band member skipped rehearsal. I’m out here like, “Who let you in the studio with that half-baked performance?”And don’t get me started on phone calls. My voice comes through so clear that folks think I’m standing next to them, and no one outside my bubble can hear a thing. So, if you’re having “top secret” convos or planning your next great escape, you’re safe with Beats. Nobody's eavesdropping on your business!Now, for my fellow noise-cancellation lovers—these things are like magic. I pop them on when I’m diving into an audiobook and BOOM, I’m in another universe. But listen, word of advice: be aware of your surroundings. I nearly karate chopped a friend who snuck up on me while I was deep in the plot of some thriller. Sorry, not sorry—it was an automatic reflex!And the seamless pairing? Chef's kiss again! These Beats slide into my Apple ecosystem smoother than butter. My iPhone 15 Pro Max, iPad Pro, and MacBook Air all link up without a hitch. Even during Zoom meetings, my co-workers hear me loud and clear, which means these headphones pull double duty for both work and play.Haven’t tested them out in the gym yet, but a few of my friends swear by them for their workouts and runs—no slipping, no fuss, just solid beats to keep them going. Bottom line? These headphones are an all-around win. If you’re still on the fence, it’s time to jump over. Get yourself some Beats and thank me later!",https://www.amazon.com/Beats-Studio-Pro-Kardashian-Compatibility/product-reviews/B0D94YRL99/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1
Unknown,R2P2UKK83OLKGG,Critical,"HP OfficeJet Pro 9125e All-in-One Printer, Color, Printer-for-Small Medium Business, Print, Copy, scan, fax,Touchscreen; Smart Advance Scan, 3 months of Instant Ink included",4,1.0,"7,554","I am a long-time HP customer, and all my printers have been HPs.  My first printer, a black-and-white HP laser printer, lasted for many years.  It was followed by an HP DeskJet 940c color printer; this printer still works, but it is now difficult to find its cartridges (I only purchase HP cartridges, and the printer rejects out-of-date cartridges) and its function is limited to printing only.  My printers since then have been HP OfficeJet Pro All-in-One Printer/Scanner/Fax — HP 8610, HP 8630, and HP 8740 — each of which has unique problems.  The HP 8610 will scan to USB, but ruins the USB drive to which files and images are scanned.  The HP 8630 fails to recognize or acknowledge the presence of a USB drive but it will scan to PC’s using its wireless capabilities and it can print using both of its paper trays.  The HP 8740, the worst until now, fails to recognize or acknowledge the presence of USB drives, it will not scan to PCs unless the PC initiates the connection, it has frequent paper jams, and the second paper tray is useless as the unit will not acknowledge its presence.  As you might imagine, it is disappointing to spend money — at the time $399, $299, and $349 (after coupon and price-match), respectively — on these all-in-one printer/scanner/fax units and not be able to use all their stated features.That said, the HP OfficeJet Pro 9015e is no different — it has problems too.  The first problem I noticed while removing it from the box is the lower quality of the build of the device.  The quality of my HP 8610, HP 8630, and HP 8740 is far greater than that of the HP 9015e; it feels cheap in comparison to the HP 8610, HP 8630, and HP 8740.  The HP 9015e does not even have a real paper tray — the back of its “paper tray” is open:  there are two long plastic hooks and no distinct location for the back placement of the paper.  Real paper trays have a clear front and back location for the paper within the tray.  The front door of the HP 9015e, via which one accesses the cartridges, does not have the high quality feel of the front doors of the HP 8610, HP 8630, and HP 8740, and this door does not close as soundly (and is not flush against the body of the unit!) as that of the other three units.  The HP 9015e does not even have a power button with a solid feel as the HP 8610, HP 8630, and HP 8740.  The sounds of the working HP 9015e are not satisfying as those for the HP 8610, HP 8630, and HP 8740:  the HP 9015e sounds rickety and as if it is falling apart.  Every time I print something, I wonder if this will be the last page I can print — I have owned this printer for less than one month at the writing of this review and there was a two-week delay before I could set up the printer at my office:  I should not feel this way about a brand new printer.  The output “tray” for the HP 9015e  is a disappointment and it does not hold printed pages well; it certainly does not hold printed pages as securely as the HP 8610, HP 8630, or HP 8740.  So far, I have been able to print several pages as well as scan to PC, initiated via the PC, but I have not been able to test the unit to its full extent.Installation using the HP Smart App was TERRIBLE!  The connection options for the HP 9015e are wireless, ethernet, and USB:  all three should work, yet the HP Smart App refused to install the printer via USB connection.  After trying to connect the HP 9015e to my Windows 10 PC multiple times — too many times — using the HP Smart App, I downloaded the only other available software option to provide printer/scanner funtionality.  This software was also problematic as it directed me to wireless or ethernet connection, rather than USB connect to PC.  However, after multiple attempts, the USB connection between the HP 9015e and my PC was established — and accepted by the software; one should not have to endure inquires from software regarding one’s choice of connection type — the owner of the device chooses the connection type, not HP via its software/app.Since I need a printer/scanner/fax at my office, I decided to keep the HP 9015e, rather than to return it.  However, I do have concerns about how long it will function and I am still in the process of determining which of its stated functions operate properly.  I do not appreciate HP trying to dictate how I connect and use the printer for which I paid:  I chose the USB connection and I chose to disable wireless printing since the printer is for my use (I paid for the printer and I pay for the cartridges), not for the use of others (who may wish to try to establish a wireless connection) at my place of work.  It is worth mentioning that the HP+ option did not appear when I installed the HP 9015e using the software rather than the HP Smart App; this is not good business, HP, as everyone purchasing this unit should be offered the same “bonus” options.Based on my experience with a firmware update for my HP 8630, I would recommend that you disable HP updates.  After the last firmware update, my HP 8630 would not recognize the perfectly functional printhead installed in the printer; I had used my printer without issues prior to this firmware update.  After that update the HP 8630 displayed a message that the printhead was now missing or damaged!  To make a long story short, I was forced to purchase a new printhead for $179 in order to continue to use this printer!  I view this as unacceptable and bad business on the part of HP.  I have no intention of going through that for the HP 9015e; I plan to turn off HP updates so that they cannot be installed via my PC.Due to the various problems that I have had with the HP 8610, HP 8630, and HP 8740 (especially its paper jams and the non-functional second paper tray), the HP 9015e may be my last HP printer because its build-quality does not compare favorably to any of the three.  What happened to the quality of my original HP laserjet and my HP 940c????  I have to wonder about the quality of future HP printers or HP all-in-one units based on the cheap feel of the HP 9015e.  I am disappointed, and I would not recommend purchasing the HP 9015e.",https://www.amazon.com/HP-OfficeJet-Wireless-Printing-403X0A/product-reviews/B0CFM82NS2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1

There is not much noticeable difference to me in start time before printing and quality of printing, but I have not been happy with the following:1) The printer is MUCH LOUDER than the 8600, which is bad for me as it’s three feet from my ear in the office. At the start of any print job, the device makes a grinding noise like a cat hacking up a hairball, and this sound is repeated after the job finishes. It is distracting and loud enough that I get away from the device until it stops.2) The printed output is pushed onto a flat piece of plastic that’s only 9 ½ inches long and with a pop-up piece of plastic so the paper curls in the air. It’s great for printing a page or two and easily grabbing it as I walk by, but it is not good for larger jobs and is terrible for photo printing, as the paper gets curled immediately when it should be lying flat drying.3) The paper tray can expand to accommodate legal-sized paper, but in its shortest position it allows you to put in both letter-sized and the longer A4 paper, so with standard 8.5"" x 11"" paper there is an almost 3/4 inch gap between end of the stack of paper and the plastic housing. Jostling to the printer can make it so the paper slides back enough that it won’t get picked up during the print process.4) The 9125e is much lighter than the 8600, but at the cost of seeming flimsy. Handle with care.5) The 9125e scanner glass bed is letter-sized while the 8600 is legal-sized. The 9125e will scan legal documents through the Automatic Document Feeder (ADF), but that doesn’t help me when I am scanning fragile paper (which I do a lot of). I knew this before I purchased it and use smartphone apps to scan larger documents (the 9125e will print legal-sized documents).6) The display panel on the printer is smaller and more difficult to read than on the 8600 and is on the left side of the printer front (which is not as convenient for right-handed people). I believe that HP intends everyone to use the HP Smart app to control the printer, so this won’t be an issue for most people.7) The setup process encourages one to sign up for an ink plan and HP+ web services, both of which entail a subscription fee. Neither of these are required, and neither of them are needed if the printer gets casual home use.Usage note (NOT MENTIONED IN THE MANUAL): When installing or changing ink cartridges, once you open the front panel you are instructed to “lift the cartridge access door by the scanner lid.” This “door” is actually the layer that includes the scanner glass, and both the scanner glass layer AND the top Automatic Document Feeder must be lifted as one unit. If you lift the ADF up first, the scanner glass layer will lock in the front left corner and not allow you to lift it.",https://www.amazon.com/HP-OfficeJet-Wireless-Printing-403X0A/product-reviews/B0CFM82NS2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1

Bought the HP OfficeJet Pro 9125e to replace the Deskjet for home use. Again it is 90% plastic so I expect the gears to eventually strip, we shall see.Printer quality is good so far BUT....> Main issue is that the number on the ink cartridges that come with it are not the correct numbers for reordering new ink (Why are these different cartridges??? Example of HP diminishing quality control or devious marketing practices??). Their operators manual does not identify the replacement ink cartridge numbers and the HP website was no help when I entered the printer name & number, it said it could not find cartridges for it....finally had to use the website's chat (live person thank god!) ... it even took her a few minutes to dig out the correct ink cartridge replacement numbers...in all it took about an hour+ to just get the correct replacement ink cartridge numbers (I have listed them below in case HP has not corrected this issue).> Second issue is replacement ink sticker shock! I am used to expensive HP ink after using the deskjet for years (e.g. $30+ per cartridge) but $50+ per cartridge (Black is $80) is incredible..... to put it in perspective, by the time you buy a second set of cartridges (a bundle of 4 is $120+ which does reduce the cost to about $30/cartridge but is a waste if you only need one color ..... usually Black which is $80/individual cartridge) ....you could have bought a new printer complete with new cartridges for a few dollars more.....AND to make it even worse, the printer now is on sale by Amazon for $90 less than what I paid (i.e. $199)..... which means a set of ink, even in the cheaper bundle of 4, is almost 3/4 the price of a new printer on sale!!! To me this is an example of new age marketing, offering a very low priced product so they can lock you in on expensive maintenance costs.Note: Watch out because HP also tries to lock you into a subscription base ink replacement program that charges/send ink every 3 months...also  HP has now installed computer chips in their ink cartridges that connect to HP through the printer's WIFI (raises the cost of the cartridges & guards against non-HP cartridges?? But also more annoying, I don't know what information the cartridges/printer is sending to HP??) ....so buyer beware....this maybe my last HP printer given there are many more options for color printing .... too bad since HP used to be the key name in electronic equipment & computer printers but has now turned into just another slick marketing company that seems to care more about profit than quality!

I get it to scan, i try and save changing the name from HP's Receipt - 0214657462168 to something useful for me. It crashes. Fire it up again. Takes several minutes to boot into a usable mode. Meanwhile ""you want to buy more ink?"" No, I've got one lousy receipt to scan. Scan a second time, ""save"" with my name. And it crashes. Printer is a pain in the butt. If I knew how difficult it would be to use it, would've bought a different one. You never can just print. You have to restart the printer to stay on the network. HP support no help at all.EDIT Sept 17, 2021 - went to do a simple scan, opened HP Smart (not an accurate name whatsoever, because it's stupid software). I could not proceed without signing in to HP account with User Name and Password. This had not occurred before. Good thing I was on internet, otherwise I couldn't even scan (you shouldn't need the internet to do that). Previewed scan, doesn't show the whole document. Reset crop, etc, quit and open again, finally see ""full size"" and select that. What a pain in the ass. Native Apple Image Capture software never a problem like this. Bad, bad software. I bought a printer. I don't want your crappy software interfering with using the darn printer.EDIT Nov 8 2021 - here i am trying to simply scan a document and can only use ""HP Smart"" software for scanning, does not work with Mac OS Image Capture. To insure the computer would recognize the printer, I printed from Mac OS print dialogue box. Success. Open up HP Smart (DUMB) software to scan and it doesn't recognize the printer whatsoever. If the computer sees the printer, why can't HP Smart see it? Now, I can't scan over the network. This is what I call a real shortcoming. What a POS.EDIT Nov 24 2021 - last time after several attempts to connect to the scanner, it ultimately worked. Tonight, over and over and it will not connect to the scanner. It prints fine. Obviously on the same network as the computer. Do not buy this printer for the scanner, it will only lead to frustration. And it seems really stupid that I am stuck with HP Smart (dumb, dumb, dumb) as the only way to scan. POS.EDIT Jan 8 2022 - Just got first bill for Instant Ink. HP says we printed 85 pages last month. Not. We haven't printed 85 pages since we got the printer in June 2021. So, how do I dispute this? HP even has a chart showing how many pages per day. It's not true. Instead of our 15 page plan for 99 cents, we're being charged 8x that. The printer works good, most of the time. HP Smart still buggy. Now I find HP is going to rip me off with no recourse. Too bad. I thought they were a good company. They are NOT. Buggy software, rip off instant ink program.Edit 22 May 2022 - the printer has been staying online pretty well the past few months. We changed from our home ethernet connection to using the Printer's Wifi connected to the home network. Today, I went to scan something and HP required me to sign in. It's just a darn printer, why do I have to sign in. HP makes a good printer, and good computers my friends tell me. So, why are they so buggy with software?Edit 8 August 2022 - last night, opened HP software and scanned two receipts. Today, went to scan something. HP software had quit. Re-opened, selected scan, and it required me to sign in. Again, HP wasting my time. It's my printer. Let me use it.Edit 25 May 2023 - today I opened HP Smart, their horrific software. We opted for the Instant Ink plan and I wanted to find out how many pages we've printed this month in order to adjust the plan if necessary. 3x I clicked on Sign In and HP Smart quit each time. Does anyone from HP Smart read these reviews? Does anyone at HP Smart use their buggy software? Will they ever make it work correctly? Also, I guess because of Mac OS updates - I can now use Mac's Image Capture to scan - and don't have to use HP Smart (so stupid because it would tell me it can't see the printer even though I just printed). This is a grand improvement. Good printer, bad software. Still. And I would complain to HP, but there is no path to do so.Edit 4 June 2023 - I'm on the HP website. I want to downgrade my plan. On the page where you choose your plan, HP states - ""Cancellations and plan downgrades are effective after the last day of the current billing period."" OK, billing period ends 6 June, today is 4 June. I select the plan, it's a downgrade. Next, HP says ""This plan downgrade is not effective immediately. You will see one more charge of $11.99 on Jun 07, 2023 before the change takes effect in the next billing cycle."" What is it I don't get? I try various ways to contact a human being. Get shipped to India. The person is immediately ""out of her scope."" She gives me a number to call. It's a robot. HP purposely is avoiding proper customer service.

The advertisements say that you get free ink with this printer.  It's actually one of the things you see as a plus in the review.  However, to get the ink, you need to sign up for Instant Ink regarding which they may provide you false or incorrect information.If you are like me and you only print maybe once or twice a week, your initial ink will last you a long time (it lasted me about 8 months).  However, to get the free ink, you need to sign up for Instant Ink free trial within a certain period of time.  I called customer service and explained that I don't use enough ink to have them regularly send me ink cartridges, so I did not want to sign up for their program.  They told me I can sign up for a free trial, get the ink and the cancel my subscription.  WHAT THEY DIDN'T TELL ME IS THAT, IF YOU CANCEL YOUR SUBSCRIPTION, YOU WON'T BE ABLE TO USE THE FREE INK. Believe it or not, if you try to use the ink when your subscription is not active, the ink cartridge will not work (they didn't bother telling me that).  Apparently, they are able to control your printer remotely to notify the printer that your subscription is cancelled.  Now they want me to sign up for a paid subscription in order to use my allegedly free ink.  Of course, I relied on the ink and did not have any ink to print when I needed it.  Not being able to print something important caused me other issues in my life.What's worse, about a month before my ink ran out, my printer refused to work at all.  I called up HP customer service and found out that it was because, even though I cancelled, my free trial must have still been active for a period of time, so my printer was still working.  When the free trial ran out, they did not have a credit card they were able to bill, so they notified my printer that I was in default of payment and I was not able to print.  I was actually trying to print something on my way out the door to get to an event and I ended up on customer service for about an hour before I was able to reach someone to unlock my printer so I could print.In other words, whenever the feel like it, they can apparently put through a code to your printer to tell it to stop printing.

So much so, we bought more than one (purchased 2, have had 3 - will explain). It has a nice form factor, modern look, easy to set up, and printed crisp and fast. I also like the instant ink and that it came with 3 months to try. Those parts were where the wonderment stopped.I'm going to start with the fact setting up the wifi was pretty fast, but the printer has an issue maintaining a connection. I'll caveat that to say, this is NOT due to the actual connection/speed/service. Half the time, the printer just doesn't print.  Multiple computers nor our phones can’t get it to do anything. We have to go through an entire process of turning it off and on, turning wifi off etc before everything starts working again. If you run out of paper, as soon as you refill it, you'd think it would pick up where it left off. Nope, it's like inside this thing freezes and it doesn't know what to do. You have to power it off and on and that doesn't even always fix it. Mind you, this has been an issue on ALL 3 of these printers, so it is not just a bad one. Sometimes, randomly even when FULL of paper, all of a sudden the computer shows ""out of paper"". I have included an error message image. This is just ONE of the dozens of error messages between these 3 printers.Now, instant ink... a magical feature, you'd think. Pay a monthly fee, get ink as needed. Great concept...until you cancel. Any ""instant ink"" cartridges that you have PAID for become bricks. Even brand new full cartridges WILL NOT WORK once you cancel your instant ink membership. That includes after the free trial. Can't even finish off what you have paid for. You have to go spend a fortune on different cartridges, so you're more or less squeezed into having to stay with the instant ink program. At least the cartridges are easy to load. In fact, that was one of our favorite features. Easiest cartridges to change of any printer we have owned, and as a graphic designer/photographer/teacher household, we have owned a LOT of printers.I have dealt with customer service numerous times. Once, we had a whole new printer sent under warranty (hence having had 3 despite only buying 2). Once, over the course of A WEEK I was talking to a CS rep daily to sort out the issues.

I struggled with installing the cartridges.  The printer goes through a series of girations after opening the lid before it settles into place.  Putting the cartridges in was tricky - they were supposed to click and lock - nope.  You had to push them in, but no lock.  I spent a good amount of time waiting for the click/lock.  Eventually I just shut the door and after a few tries where the cartridges weren't in their happy position it finally took.2.  I had alot of trouble with my MAC laptop setup to the printer.  (the original setup was through my Dell desktop).  The printer is online, I can see it from the app - but when I try to print it is not an available printer.  When I try to add it manually in Printers app - it took a few tries where it kept saying it couldn't communicate with the printer.

Once the cartridges are recognized, then the print heads were easy to align.* The HP Smart wizard was very simple and seemed straight forward to me.* Once the printer was on the Wi-Fi, it was very easy for all devices in our household to connect.* Unfortunately, I missed the time limit sign up for HP+ which, their service that includes 3 months of Instant Ink and an extra year warranty. You have to sign up within 7 days of setup.Usage:1. On first activation, the printer takes a few moments to align the printer cartridges. This may seem loud in a very quiet room. After the first time, I expected the setup noise.2. My power cord seems a bit touchy. A slight bump and the printer turns off. I'm going to try a cord replacement since it is a standard type.3.

Although a compact size for the printing job it performs, it is bigger than other printers I have owned and it was incredibly easy to remove it from its box. The printer was bagged with handles to pull out with when the box is on its side. No having to hassle with the box versus the printer. The printer is beautiful - I love the look of it. It looks modern and sleek. The instructions that came with were very straightforward and easy to follow during set up and ink installation. I typically only use the print feature as I print a lot of labels daily. I do use the scan and copy feature every now and then. It was easy to figure out how to use those features (which on other printers I've used they are not that intuitive). The printer quality on the paper is great! The ink lines are crisp making it easy to read or look at. In my particular case, I have no problems when scanning the labels with tiny lines in the barcodes. It prints very quickly and holds a lot of paper. The only drawbacks of the printer I encountered is that it is a bit noisy while printing, but I have yet to discover a printer that isn't noisy since it's a machine. Also the ink replacement cartridges are a bit pricey compared to what I was using. I was using ink that was refillable and could print thousands of sheets without refilling.",https://www.amazon.com/HP-OfficeJet-Wireless-Printing-403X0A/product-reviews/B0CFM82NS2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1

It took 7 tries to get it set up and connected to the internet. The first 5 tries were over WiFi where it became unresponsive after continuing setup in the HP Smart app. I got it almost done with ethernet connectivity but it disconnected after I declined the HP+ limitations. Trying one last time over ethernet I got it to work. After about 45 minutes, I was finally able to print something. This color inkjet does a great job with text and image, coming out perfectly sharp and smudge-free. Because it's an inkjet, it's surprisingly loud compared to the HP Laserjet 2600n that I used before. The print speed is faster than my old HP Laserjet. With the print head moving rapidly back and forth, this printer shakes a lot while printing. While using the ADF, it's the loudest I've heard on an all-in-one printer. The scan was a tinge slow, but the quality was phenomenal. The scans came out perfectly straight and legible. It's painful to set up but once you get it going, it works perfectly for an inkjet and I haven't had any issues after setting it up.

Next, I looked at my pics in the hp app. I clicked on 2 to print. I hit the button, and they instantly shot out. My mouth flew open, and I questioned how? I had just clicked the button! My husband and I were amazed with the quality. Our old printer of another brand never prints anywhere close to that good or nearly as fast. It would have taken much much longer to print them on our old printer. My husband set it up on his phone. Then, he printed our insurance cards and a ticket to a show. They both printed quickly. I was messing around in the hp app, and printed some cards and coloring pages. They all printed in great quality. I've since printed more recipes, some vet records, and other papers. I'm loving the quality and quickness. I'm not sure how the whole paying for ink monthly will work. I'm not sure if it'll be cheaper or not. Our old printer didn't have the option to print on 2 sides. We haven't had one of those in yrs, so I like that we have that option back in the house. I forgot when I was printing recipes that I had that option again. I guess I'll have to print them again if I want them double sided. My daughter will be using it lots to print stuff for school. It was very easy to use the screen then the app to follow setup steps. It prints better than my old printer but the cost is cheaper. I don't know how. I say it's a good value for the money. I haven't had it long enough to see how well it will function over time but for now it is working great. It came with 3 months of free ink and 1 month of free paper. I've already received both in the mail. I canceled the paper, but it says I will be billed for October, even though there is still plenty of time before then. If I get billed for a month I won't be using the paper option I won't be happy. That makes me believe, if you end up canceling the ink, you'll still get billed. I don't think you should be if you cancel it early enough like I did on the paper. If I get billed for paper I won't receive for the following month I will cancel the ink. I will not support that. The weight of the printer isn't too bad. I'm able to pick it up myself and move it.Overall, if you print lots of normal random stuff like I do, I think you'll like this printer.

I've had several other home printers in the past, including a laser printer (great because it uses dry toner which doesn't have the issues an inkjet printer typically has, but is only able to print black and white). I've had several inkjet printers, but they all end up having clogged print heads or something that renders them useless after a short amount of time. I thought I'd give this a try, as it could replace my other printers.It's meant for a small office, as it has pretty high duty cycles. I don't print a lot; usually recipes, legal documents, and coupons. I may start printing some newsletters for an organization I'm in, so this may work out well. It can print borderless pages, which would make some nice newsletters!Setting up the printer was fairly straight-forward. The printer was packaged nicely, in a bag with a handle that allows you to pull it from the box easily. The included quick-start guide tells you to plug it in, turn it on, select a language and country, and then go to a URL to set the printer up on your computer or phone wirelessly.The first step is to open the paper tray and load the paper. Adjusting the paper tray for letter-sized paper was a bit confusing, as there are little tabs you have to press to adjust the size of the paper tray. It wouldn't shrink down to the size of the paper, so I just pushed the paper all the way to the back and pushed the tray in. The printer then said it was checking the paper, and said it was successfully loaded.Installing the ink went fine.Then it wants to print an alignment page. Once printed, you put it on the scanner bed, and it scans. That went fine as well.Finally, install HP Smart Printing on the computer and scan for new printers. It didn't find it on the first try, but did on the second. Connecting was quick and easy. It even got the wifi password from the computer. Once connected it automatically updated the firmware. I didn't realize it, so I tried printing something and couldn't. Then the printer chimed and said the firmware was updated.Print quality is fantastic, as is the speed of printing. I enrolled in the HP+ and Instant Ink trial. I got an email saying my new ink cartridges were being shipped, even though I don't need them yet. I'll probably cancel the Instant Ink after the trial, as I don't print a lot, but it may be worthwhile for people/offices that do. Time will tell if the print heads last.

After unboxing the printer, the setup was super straightforward and seamless, and the touchscreen interface is very intuitive for all ages. Also, compared to my old HP, the printer is smaller and was able to fit on a shelf which the previous printer was too big for. The biggest selling point for me was everything you get for the price. Copying, scanning, faxing, and of course printing. I frequently have to print and scan documents at my WFH job, and this makes my day to day much simpler with how easy the printer is to use.The first thing I did after plugging in the printer was setup wireless printing. It was a breeze to connect to my home wifi with the 2.7in touchscreen. Navigation of the settings is quick and efficient. After that, I did some test printing of hotel reservations for an upcoming trip. What surprised me was the speed of the printer and how well the pages looked for printing so fast. I am very impressed with the print quality and there are absolutely no complaints with the result. Additionally, setting up the HP Smart app on my phone impressed me. It was able to find my printer in just a few seconds and I was printing only a few minutes after downloading the app. This is something a non-tech person would have no problem in setting up as well. Additionally, the printer has many functions like faxing, scanning, and copying. I scan a lot when I have to use a handwritten signature and there are more options than I would ever imagine in how to scan and where to send the result. I love the flexibility that comes with the entire HP printer solution. The connectivity between the mobile app has changed how I print because my previous printer was getting too old to even connect properly to the internet. I really love this printer, and it is exceptional for the price. I highly recommend it to anyone who needs an easy-to-use printer for everyday home and business needs.Lastly, the 3 months of printing that comes with the printer is a big bonus!

With the ever-increasing demands of remote work and hybrid working setups, a reliable and fast printer is essential. The OfficeJet Pro 9125e fits this role perfectly, offering a balance of robust performance, high-quality output, and a range of modern features designed to meet the needs of a busy home office. ### Speed and Efficiency One of the first aspects that make the HP OfficeJet Pro 9125e a great option for high-traffic environments is its impressive print speed. Capable of printing up to 24 pages per minute (ppm) for black and white documents and 20 ppm for color, this printer can handle large print jobs without significant delays. This speed is crucial for home offices that need to print a high volume of documents on a regular basis, such as reports, presentations, or marketing materials. The fast two-sided printing (automatic duplexing) feature further enhances efficiency, reducing paper use while speeding up large print jobs. The 9125e’s 35-page automatic document feeder (ADF) adds another layer of convenience for multitasking users, enabling quick scanning, copying, or faxing of multipage documents. Coupled with its 250-sheet input tray, this printer minimizes the need for constant refilling, making it well-suited for high-volume tasks. ### Print Quality Despite its speed, the HP OfficeJet Pro 9125e does not compromise on print quality. With a resolution of up to 1200 x 1200 dpi (dots per inch) for black and 4800 x 1200 dpi for color, the printer consistently delivers crisp and vibrant results. Whether you're printing text-heavy documents or detailed graphics, the output maintains professional quality. This makes the 9125e not only ideal for standard office documents but also for marketing materials, presentations, and more visually demanding tasks that require accurate color representation. ### Smart Features and Connectivity What sets the OfficeJet Pro 9125e apart from many other home office printers is its integration with HP’s innovative smart features. The printer is equipped with HP’s Smart App, allowing users to print, scan, and copy directly from their smartphone or tablet, regardless of location. This feature is essential for busy professionals who need to manage print jobs on the go. In summary, the HP OfficeJet Pro 9125e is a fantastic printer.",https://www.amazon.com/HP-OfficeJet-Wireless-Printing-403X0A/product-reviews/B0CFM82NS2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1

No concerns with delivery or packaging. Product box arrived totally undamaged and product was easy to unpack, had minimal packing garbage which I liked. Set: 2/5 - It it very rare these days that setup with a new product goes smoothly. This setup was no exception. At first I was excited there was a QR code to scan to provided step by step instructions and that is about where my excitement for the setup ended. I could barley get past step 1 which was loading the paper (pro tip: don't push the paper all the way into the printer, push the paper towards you so it is flush with the edge of the outer drawer). Step two was equally frustrating where I had to load the ink, I am not sure if what I did was what was needed but after I installed the ink I had to move the cartridge around in order to get past the error in setup. Step 3 again had some snags with the alignment, it wouldn't align so I turned off the printer and turned it back on and it worked. The final step was also met with many issues. During the software setup I had to close and restart the APP multiple times which was frustrating but I made it! Printing: 4.9 - Love the fast printing with options to print from USB or any WifI connected device. Also love that this has the ability to print double-sided pages (an upgrade from my previous OfficeJet). No complaints on the color printing, looks pretty standard. My only complaint is the limited page size compatibility, would love to be able to print on larger pieces of paper. Scanning/Copying: 5/5 - Copying from the unit works as expected, nothing special to note. I LOVE how you can scan from you phone through the APP, that is a great feature I will use often. Longevity: TBD - I haven't had this long enough to say how it will hold up or how long the ink lasts. They do have a program where you can paper per month per page for ink that seems reasonable if you don't want to run out of ink, my printing is too sporatic to justify a monthly plan. APP: 4/5 - Knocking points off for my setup experience.

O sea, no tiene un indicador que prevenga de conectar.3) El protector es muy delicado, el lápiz queda apegas sujetado del mismo, y se me ha salido apenas con el roce de la  mochila  al guardarlo o sacarlo. También al moverlo fuera de la mochila. Muy poco seguro.4) El borrador no tiene la opción de borrar trazos, sin embargo el software utiliza trazos para guardar los dibujo, por lo que no lo hace no porque no puedan sino porque no quieren. El borrado de trazos es muy práctico en muchas ocasiones y lo tienen casi por defecto todos las app que conozco de dibujo salvo las antiguar app de dibujo por pixeles que ya ni sé si existen.5) No permite elegir la orientación de la pantalla, o sea que cuando se pone horizontal hay una sola forma horizontal. Eso es muy incómodo cuando se trabaja con el lápiz, porque éste queda sujeto en la parte de abajo, y si bien es magnético y se puede ""pegar"" al costado, dicho  ""pegado"" es débil y se sale fácil y peligrososamente (ver foto)6) El lápiz, luego de muy poco uso, comenzó a tener comportamiento extraños como ser detectado 1 cm de la pantalla. Lo arreglé sacando el ""grafo""y volviéndolo a colocar. Pero fue muy extraño.7) No recuerda la posición original de una patanlla en modo horizontal, de modo que al ir hacia adelanta y luego volver, ¡cambia la posición de la hoja! algo increíblemente molesto e incómodo. A ver ese CEO si se pone las pilas!8) La suscripción al servicio ""Connect"" solo esta habilitado para algunos países, pero por ejemplo para ninguno de América del Sur, algo inaudito. Igual para lo que cobran y para el servicio que dan, no creo que me hubiera suscrito.9) Cuando se usa el lápiz remarcado y se exporta el documento a Dropbox, la página donde se haya usado el remarcado, sale toda oscura! una cosa increíble! pero cuando se comparte por email, la página sale correctamente.Now in English:Pros1) The item is aesthetically very nice, fine and elegant, as well as its cover and pencil.2) It turns on quickly compared to my OnyxCons1) The screen texture is not as rough as a Wacom could be, but better than an iPad.2) The battery lasts a long time but it turned off without warning. That is, it does not have an indicator that prevents it from connecting.3) The protector is very delicate, the pencil remains attached to it, and it has barely come off with the friction of the backpack when putting it away or taking it out. Also when moving it out of the backpack. Very unsafe.4) The eraser does not have the option to delete strokes, however the software uses strokes to save the drawings. Therefore, the engineers who designed the software did not offer that option not because they did not know how to do it but because they did not want to do it, for some reason that I cannot imagine. What it is is very frustrating. Erasing strokes is very practical on many occasions and almost all the drawing apps I know have it by default except for the old pixel drawing apps that I don't even know if they exist anymore.5) It does not allow you to choose the orientation of the screen, that is, when it is landscape mode there is only one landscape orientation.

No phone calls at all.  The support team gave me a list things to do that might remedy the situation.  Nothing fixed it.  They wanted a video of the tablet to see what it is not doing.  PEOPLE IT WASNT DOING A DAMN THING. No video is needed. Be careful.  I will say again it works great until.  I have 1000’s of notes that I have now lost.  Completely threw my work off.

It is simple and does exactly what it says on the tin. You can write on it and it will shows what you are writing. There is no backlight, color, or grayscale images. The pen is not touch sensitive harder or longer presses do not give darker lines so the images that look like drawing in the advertisements are difficult to accomplish.  They did texture the screen to make it feel somewhat like paper, that being said you won't confuse it for paper.The only semi-fancy part of it is the handwriting to text feature (which requires it to be online).It is on the heavy side, close to the weight of a medium sized college text book. I hope that means it is durable and will last a long time.Inputs using your finger are sluggish and may require multiple taps to register. The pen is better but still slow. This makes using the on-screen keyboard is difficult. Taking notes seems pretty responsive though.It works well for left handed people as you can choose if the menu is on the left or right.You can't download your files directly from the device to your computer using a USB cable, and you can only transfer the documents via their services (either online or email). I am afraid it will become useless in a few years when they shut down the servers and you can't get your files, or convert handwriting to text anymore.You can give them your credit card and sign up for their app to sync files between multiple devices.

I was getting the hang of improving my organization within the R2 with tags and separate notebooks... THEN Recently I got a 0% battery alert while working and plugged it in. It has never come back. I contacted support and tried all the suggestions. Now i have to ship it back for replacement. Since I've been researching, the R2 doesn't do well with fast chargers although I was not using one to charge it (it was plugged into a USB at my desk). Just FYI.Ok, these things happen. But the return process is really poor: I can only use DHL apparently, which is really, really inconvenient based on their locations. I don't feel like paying another carrier to ship this dead tablet to China so I'll be driving out of my way to DHL when any other shipping company would be no ttrouble.

It looks good, writing is a joy, and it is distraction-free. The price is high, but I feel that it is justified by how much better it is than the competition.My issue is that the device does not work well for left-handers. I actually bought this because it is the only current option that has a left-hand mode. But what does that ""left-handed mode"" actually DO? Some options that are, to me, purely cosmetic, are shifter over. Great.But infruriatingly they kep the little ""x"" in the top left, which immediately closes out the current document. That 'x' is exactly where I put my hand when starting off a fresh document, and where I frequently brush up against when writing on the top 1/3 or so of a page. No notes are lost, but I have to choose the right notebook again and find my place in the notes. Yes, I could re-learn the fundamentals of how I've written for 40 years, but it is easier to just give this away to a family member.My 2nd minor issue is that the OEM case/cover options need to have a place for the pen. Do NOT rely on the magnent to keep it in place in your bag or elsewhere - it may work for a while, but you will eventually lose it.I would recommend this for folks who write with their right hand, but for others - wait for a software update or competing product.",https://www.amazon.com/reMarkable-Essentials-Bundle-Marker-Folio/product-reviews/B0BJJ5FJ6H/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1

Sometimes I have to swipe at it like 10 times to get it to scroll up. Sometimes I will write something and then a second later some of my writing will vanish.The most baffling thing is all the missing obvious features. Part of my hope with this was replacing my giant pile of graphing composition notebooks because I do a lot of drafting. You can format your pages as graph paper which would be perfect. Unfortunately there are pretty much no basic drawing tools. You can draw a straight line if you draw a line then pause until it straightens the line. It's awkward and only works about half the time.No circle tool, no rectangles, no squares, no polygon, no measuring.

My journey started with the Kindle Scribe, which I initially bought for reading on a larger screen. Once I discovered the joy of note-taking on an E-Ink tablet, I delved deeper into the market and stumbled across the reMarkable 2, which is often hailed as one of the best in its category. That’s when I decided to give it a try, seeking a more refined, “paper-like” experience compared to the Kindle Scribe.Now, I’m absolutely hooked on the reMarkable 2, carrying it with me everywhere. The device fits seamlessly into my daily routine, but whenever colleagues ask about it, I give them this disclaimer: “I love it, but I’d never recommend it lightly.”The key here is that anyone interested in the reMarkable 2 must first do their homework. It’s essential to understand its specific use case and the design philosophy behind it. Unlike many gadgets that try to do everything fairly well, the reMarkable 2 is a specialized tool that excels at one thing—replicating the paper notebook experience digitally. For that, it’s nearly unparalleled.However, this specialization comes with trade-offs. The reMarkable 2 is highly focused and minimalist. It lacks many features that modern tablet users might take for granted: there’s no email access, no web browser, no third-party apps, and you won’t find social media or even a backlight for nighttime use. For some, this can feel like a “dumbed-down” tablet, especially given that at its price point, you could opt for an iPad or other E Ink tablets with more functionality. If you’re looking for a multi-purpose device, this might seem limiting and even frustrating.That said, the writing experience on the reMarkable 2 is where it shines. The textured E-Ink display combined with the Marker offers a tactile feel that closely mimics writing on paper. With pressure sensitivity and multiple pen options, it’s incredibly responsive, making it perfect for note-taking, sketching, and journaling. However, it may fall short for artists looking for a more versatile tool since the drawing features are limited compared to more advanced tablets.Where the reMarkable 2 does offer some digital conveniences is in its cloud syncing capabilities. With their Connect service (which costs $3/month after a free trial), you can sync your notes across devices, giving you access to your notebooks on your phone or computer. For me, this feature justifies the subscription cost because it adds an extra layer of productivity, allowing me to keep my notes organized and accessible anytime, anywhere.Ultimately, the reMarkable 2 is ideal for people who are looking for a distraction-free, premium notebook replacement that delivers on its promise of a paper-like experience. It’s elegant, well-built, and high quality, but it’s also designed for a very specific use case. If you’re someone who wants more functionality or expects a typical tablet experience, there are better alternatives in both the tablet and E-Ink markets. But if you value simplicity, focus, and a top-tier writing experience, the reMarkable 2 is the way to go.I personally use it daily and even bought one for my wife. But I also recognize that for some, it may not hit the mark. As I always say, do your research before committing to it.",https://www.amazon.com/reMarkable-Essentials-Bundle-Marker-Folio/product-reviews/B0BJJ5FJ6H/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1

If you toss and turn, you will inadvertently put pressure on the chassis an activate the screen which is quite bright in a dark room.  There is no way to disable this, but after putting it on my ankle, this issue goes away.  Sleep tracking works on the ankle (if you are NOT using clip-on body mode).  I worry that this Fitbit wasn't tuned for the ankle.  That is, I move my ankles less than my wrists when lying in bed.This tracker does not work well when using with a treadmill desk.  In order to get an accurate step count, you need to wear on your ankle but tell the app you are wearing it in ""clip-on body"" mode.  This mode unfortunately disables heart tracking.  I would love to see a ""worn on ankle"" mode that addresses these issues.  This Fitbit does not track any treadmill steps if my pace is on my treadmill's lowest setting.  I hope they adjust the min speed threshold because I walk for hours per day on this setting as I work.The screen is small which is great, but why can't we have all those on-screen controls available in the app too?  If I want to toggle clip-on body mode, and it's a tedious to swipe and click on that tiny screen--especially if worn on ankle.  My phone, on the other hand, has a large screen.Automatic sleep detection is wildly inaccurate in terms of when sleep begins.  This could be a result of wearing it on my ankle.  One night it said I went to sleep at 7:20pm and was restless until 11:20pm.  In reality, I went to sleep at 11:20pm.  There's a way to manually edit the start time which I did, but then later my manual edit was overwritten, and I had to do it a second time.  This bug happens routinely.  There is an option to tell the device explicitly when you start sleeping and stop in real-time, but if I use this feature, it shows an error code 0x and most of my sleep stats are missing.  In general, the software has lots of little bugs like this: the premium feature called ""Meet your sleep animal"" ignores my manual edits of my sleep start and end times.  I know this because it says on average it takes me one hour to fall asleep which way off from my manual edits.Heart rate tracking seems to work perfectly when worn on the ankle.  A strategy for treadmill desks users could be to use Fitbit for heart rate tracking and sleep tracking only, and then use your iPhone for step tracking as iPhone is more accurate and convenient.  You would just need to place the iPhone in a pocket near the knee (cargo shorts) so that steps are counted.There is no way to manually turn off the device.  The only way to turn it off is to let the battery drain to zero.  As far as I know, storing a device with zero charge for long periods of time will permanently damage a battery.What I liked about my Fitbit is that I have learned my Resting Heart Rate (RHR) and Heart Rate Variability (HRV).  I learned I probably don't have sleep apnea or attrib fib.  I'm not using my Fitbit anymore.  In a year or so, I will dust it off and check these stats again.

Worn it to bed every single night. Of those 20 nights I've gotten THREE nights where it has recorded a sleep score. It's nice to see my REM and Deep Sleep cycles and to put some loose value on the quality of sleep I'm getting. I had to go to the FitBit site to try and trouble shoot why I only got 3 nights...I *think* (not 100% sure, but based on FitBit help pages this is my assumption) you have to have the watch SNUG at night to get a good reading for sleep. And when I say snug I mean I have the SMALL band so tight I only have 3 notches left to go before I'm out of notches. I'd say I have average to small wrists, so If you have REALLY small wrists you could be out of luck unless you get a 3rd party band. I will likely go that route as the firmer plastic that tight is not comfortable and leaves massive dents.The worst part of not getting but 3 days of sleep score is that the monthly sleep profile needs 14 nights of sleep score to give you a sleep profile, so that likely isn't going to happen this month unless I can get a sleep score every night for pretty much the rest of the month. And then the ""Readiness Score"" also needs the sleep data. So I got a score yesterday (Monday) because it gave me a sleep score for Sunday night. I can't judge that aspect of it on one score.I did wear it in the pool today and it seems fine in regards to the water resistance. My gripe there is that I was doing water aerobics and there is no quick option for that - just swimming. So I had to go back into the app and add my activity and the time frame. Not the worst thing, but if it's an exercise option within the app I wish I could set it as a quick select for my watch as it's something I may continue doing on a regular basis.Still would't upgrade the star rating at this point, nor would I pay the 10 bucks a month for premium with the data I've gotten thus far.***** Original Review *****I will admit I've not had my new FitBit for more than 24 hours yet as I start writing this -- BUT -- This is my 3rd or 4th FitBit in the last decade or so. I go between FitBit and Apple Watch. I'll pro/con this from my prior knowledge of what FitBit was prior to Google buying it. I already utilize the apps FitOn for exercise videos along with LoseIt! for food logging, so that plays into my review.Pros:The screens now are SO much better.Battery life is better than in the past.Way more information in a compact device - It's more than just tracking 10000 steps with 5 dotstsw now.Bands are more comfortable than prior models, and have plenty of 3rd party options.FitBit now has exercise videos in app. (You'll see this in cons, I'll explain.)Clock and App Gallery. (Also going to appear in cons.)Meal ideas. (Another double edged sword here too.)Cons: (Maybe grab a snack right now, it's going to take a minute.)The App... is simply atrocious. With what I'm seeing right now, I can't say paying for premium is going to be worth anything. Unless the health data and readiness score are absolutely mind blowing I really can't fathom spending 10 bucks a month on it. I've also noticed that an issue with the Inspire 3 not showing things like breathing and skin temp are all over the help pages on FitBit. I'll try and remember to update if that all shows up in the coming days like it says it should.** Groups no longer exist. You can have a group with your personal friends you add on, but you cannot find a public group if you wanted to just talk to people about something like meal prep. There is no more social aspect to to the app aside from adding friends. I can partake in groups on LoseIt! and FitOn both.** Clock and App Gallery - there's limited clock faces for the Inspire 3. The stock one it comes loaded with is the one I like the best, and you have THREE whole color theme options (green, orange, purple). There are apps I cannot load onto my Inspire like FitOn, which REALLY irks me off as that's my primary exercise video app (more on that below). My Apple Watch had an app too that synced my heart rate to FitOn.** Speaking of things the FitBit won't work with... It won't sync any data with Apple Health - I will have to see if my FitBit syncing with the LoseIt! app will do so.** Exercise videos: There seems to be a good bit to choose from, some are for Premium subscribers only like most apps, which isn't a huge deal. My dislike on this is there is precious little to sort the videos by. My FitOn app I can go by time, equipment needed, body part I want to focus on, and even the trainer. There are 6 filter options on the FitBit app. They have groups such as ""no equipment needed"" or ""weights only"" but then there's also ones I came across that require a treadmill or push-up bar, but you don't know that until you click on the video itself.** Meal ideas are awesome, but on the FitBit app they are all in video format. I don't want to watch a video to get the recipe. I want an ingredients list and directions I can *read*. Looking at a few videos they are short, like 36 seconds, and at no point do they tell you how much to use in the ones I looked at as they are backed by music. Again, I can find recipes in a clear format on my other two apps.My conclusion:I already gave my Apple Watch to my kid, or I'd be very tempted to send this back. Is it worth a Benjamin Franklin? Not really, and especially not when the potentially useful features require me to continue paying a monthly fee. I'd say this is worth perhaps 60 bucks tops, so if you see at that price point, then maybe go for it.TL;DR:If you use other apps already for fitness and food tracking, or are looking for the old school social aspect of FitBit, then you likely should look elsewhere because Google is running the lower end trackers and the app into the ground in hopes that you will price up to the smart watch options. I had hoped that those articles saying as much were being a little dramatic... they're not.

I don't need to monitor heart rate, stress, or any of the other features the Inspire touts. I got this only because Google, now corporate masters of FitBit, no longer support the FitBit One which was working perfectly fine as a product and doing exactly what it said on the tin, right up to where they decided to let it wither on the vine and the software stopped syncing steps with my iPhone. By comparison, the Inspire 3 has its pros: automatic sleep logging (no more fumbling in a daze for the sleep start/stop button!) and more accurate step counting... so long as you wear it on your ankle. (Who the hell thought you could accurately track steps by arm movement?) Cons: it's a real pain in the ass that most of the functions are only accessible through the touch screen of the device itself and not through the iPhone app. Like setting the alarm, which is kind of critical to my working life. Ultimately, that didn't matter because the alarm DOES. NOT. WORK. AT. ALL. I am grateful to my cats, who woke me up in time to go to work on the first three days I wore the thing to bed. Fortunately, the One will still sync alarm settings from my phone, so now I wear the One at night for only that reason and use the Inspire as a step-counting anklet during the day. It's less work than trying to return the thing and find an alternative. (And yes, I looked hard at Garmin and other brands in hopes of being able to give Google the old heave-ho, but ultimately the price point on the Inspire had them beat.)",https://www.amazon.com/Fitbit-Management-Intensity-Tracking-Midnight/product-reviews/B0B5F9SZW7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1

I was between the Inspire 2 and 3. I ended up going with the 3 because of the newer features, especially the nighttime oxygen saturation tracking. About a month after getting the Inspire 3 and using it 24/7 besides showering, I did a sleep study…I went into the sleep study confident that I did not have sleep apnea because the Inspire 3 said that my nighttime oxygen saturation was fine at an average of 96% with low variation. However, I ended up being diagnosed with moderate sleep apnea after my sleep study detected an average of 16 apnea/hypopnea events (SpO2 <89%) per hour. Unfortunately I learned this just after the return period for my Inspire 3 had ended, otherwise I would’ve returned it.I understand that this device is not intended to diagnose any medical condition etc etc, but I feel like I wasted my money getting the Inspire 3 instead of the lower cost Inspire 2 that would’ve been just as useful to me.As far as features that it shares with the 2, this is a great device and did help me track my sleep duration and phases. The sleep tracking and heart rate monitoring seem to be pretty accurate. The battery life is also fantastic. I charged it once a week when I was using it consistently, and it would still be at about 40% at that point. Keep in mind, I did not enable phone notifications on my device, which is supposed to significantly impact the battery life.Assuming those features are consistent between devices, I’d recommend the Inspire 2 but not the 3.",https://www.amazon.com/Fitbit-Management-Intensity-Tracking-Midnight/product-reviews/B0B5F9SZW7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1

I like it when it works.  It is small (I have a small wrist so the Apple watch is too large), counts steps and mostly gives you your messages and calendar alerts.  I say mostly because it is easy to turn these alerts off by accident.  And, when it is starting to fail, it does not do so.My current Fitbit began having serious issues about a month before its' warranty was up.

They refused to help me on the phone because my case had already been ""escalated"".  Two minutes after hanging up, the same representative who I spoke to wrote me an email saying my Fitbit was out of warranty and here was a 35% discount to purchase, but only from Google shop.  We had already discussed that the problems started before warranty expired.  I had already said to her that a solution that said it was out of warranty was not honorable.  After all, Fitbit support had bee dragging the watch past the warranty line with fixes that did not stick. So, if you choose to buy the Inspire 3, just know this is basically a ""subscription"" watch where you need to re-purchase every year.

The Fitbit devices and apps that were developed by the original Fitbit team were excellent, accurate, reliable and their customer service was responsive.None of that is true of the current Fitbit experience and tech ever since Google acquired Fitbit in 2021.I bought a Google Fitbit Inspire 3 a year ago when my Fitbit One (from the original, pre-Google Fitbit team) finally gave up the ghost after twelve years of great use. It was a sad moment.The Google Fitbit Inspire 3 doesn't hold battery power well - it drains quickly. It must be worn on my wrist (unlike the Fitbit One that clipped to the waistband of my pants or a pocket) and it doesn't record steps as accurately as the Fitbit One device did. Also, because I already had a smartwatch (for things other than steps and sleep) it is ridiculous that if I want to maintain and continue my Fitbit stats I must wear two devices on my wrist. (I feel like those stereotypes of guys on the streets of New York, who open their coats to reveal slew of watches and ask passersby, ""Hey, you wanna buy a watch?""In addition to the downsides of the duplicative and inaccurate step counts wrist tracker, Google has destroyed the Android app that the Inspire 3 must sync to so that counts of steps, sleep time, heart rate, etc. don't match anymore from the worn device to the mobile apps. It appears as if the Google-managed Fitbit app is just making up random numbers. That app inaccuracy renders the Fitbit devices useless if the data they are supposed to capture, record and generate detailed historical patterns with (not to mention sync with partner apps!) are not accurate. At minimum it's a two-part fitness system: device and app. If one or the other doesn't work correctly, accurately or reliably, the system is worthless. That's the state Fitbit is at now under Google's management.My recommendation: Don't adopt any Google fitness solutions (Fitbit or Pixel). They don't seem to be able to code apps correctly or accurately and their product management people are unresponsive to many many users reporting similar issues on their Fitbit discussion forums. In addition, they've dropped popular features, have discontinued the once-loved desktop Dashboard charge a lot for their ""Premium"" app (translate that to mean obtuse and unneeded + with all the same bugs noted above).

I picked this one as it was much smaller than the charge 2 which I always felt was kind of big and clunky. This is much smaller and it does have some nice features but it also has some annoying parts too. I like that I can see my phone notifications on it and I also like that you can turn it to sleep mode so it doesn't blind you  when you turn over in bed at night. The vibrate notification that you have a message seems to vary as sometimes it is very obvious and sometimes I don't even feel it. The step count accuracy seems to be similar to the charge 2 which means not terribly but probably within maybe 25 steps. There isn't a clock face that I love so I am resigned to having the time be in 2 rows of numbers. Whoever designed the band should be sentenced to sit and replace them over and over for a couple of weeks as punishment as the connector is awful. I don't know who decided this type was a good idea but it is terrible. It reminds me of the old watch bands that you had to use a small screwdriver to get off if your band broke. If you have no fingernails, you don't have a prayer of getting this on or off but if you do have fingernails, you're probably going to break one replacing the band. It is also hard to be sure that it is seated all the way in and won't fall off your arm. I ordered additional bands which I had to return as the pins wouldn't seat in the watch so replacement bands may or may not work well. I ordered the yellow original band inspire 3 as the additional bands I also ordered had a black band but I had to return them so if I had known that, I would have ordered the black band one. I am also having an issue with the swipe feature as most of the time when I swipe, it just turns itself off so I am repeatedly tapping to wake it up and then, swipe, it goes to sleep, tap tap, wake up, swipe go to sleep multiple times which is very annoying. Also the battery life icon is not for the faint of sight as it is very very tiny. So after fighting to get the screen to swipe up, I had better be wearing my glasses if I want to see how much battery is left as it is a very small icon and teeny numbers up in the top corner of the screen that also includes the date and the step count. It seems like a lot to cram onto the screen especially when the battery life is kind of useful to be able to read. I know I said I like the smaller screen but I also want to be able to see the things on it. The battery does last pretty well which is nice. So do I love it, no.

So far, the battery life has been great, getting about a full week/week and a half before I need to charge it (it charges pretty fast too, only takes maybe an hour).If you've had an Inspire before, it definitely took some time getting used to the different layout this watch uses. I'm not the world's biggest fan of how the notifications pop-up and look in the notification menu, but I'm not complaining either.The only thing I miss from my Inspire 2 is the Tile Tracking feature. The GPS on the watch is only for measuring exercise. I knew this before purchasing, but it's something to keep in mind if you're someone like me who lost their previous watch while hiking.

Chose the Inspire because I cannot stand 1. Hulky, sweat inducing things on my wrist, 2. Receiving texts or phone calls on a devise too small to operate easily and 3. Paying for yet another devise on my cell phone plan.  When this devise fails, I will replace it with grumbling (for having to wade back into the decision and set-up rabbit-hole) but few qualms about the cost.I love most of the features that Fitbit offers for free on their app.  I think most of them are accurate enough - although they have major odd hiccup days about once every 9-12 months.  The devise offers a lot of tracking options that I don’t use and wish I could turn off.  I will accidentally swipe or tap my wrist wrong and end up in menus that are challenging to find your way out of.  Thank goodness for YouTube and Google answers.A good choice for me.

Unknown,R294EPMGY8EA6R,Positive,"Fitbit Inspire 3 Health &-Fitness-Tracker with Stress Management, Workout Intensity, Sleep Tracking, 24/7 Heart Rate and more, Midnight Zen/Black One Size (S & L Bands Included)",4.3,4.0,"14,878","GPS: I saw a review crying about needing to have phone on body in order to have GPS tracked. The features of the Inspire 3 compared to other models are CLEARLY listed in THIS product description. This model has CONNECTED GPS (means it will talk to phone), or you can choose a model with GPS built in (no need to have phone on you). ZERO surprises here.STEP COUNT: I find it accurate, leaning toward underestimation, which is fine. Never have I found it to over estimate. Seems about as accurate as all the other Fitbit products I have used over the past 10 years. If you find it over estimating for whatever reason, then raise your goal.SCREEN CLARITY: good color, clean clear presentation. I have been using their smart watches the past several years, so I wasnt sure what to expect from their ""low end"" basic model. Very clear. Very different (and better) than basic models of 8-10 years ago.SCREEN USE: very receptive to my touch. I can tap the screen and see the time, date, and steps, and then scroll UP to see: date, battery amount, steps, distance, floors, hourly activity progress, heart rate(actual and resting), sleep and sleep score, Sp02, menstrual info, exercise progress. Scroll DOWN, to see alarm if you have one set, or want to turn off. Along with other options. Use SIDE button and swipe left or right for other information and settings stuff.BATTERY LIFE:. Lasts forever. I have my watch set to only turn on with a tap. I didnt want to see it every time I flicked my wrist. That also takes away from batter life. There are likely other settings and such that decrease battery life, but as of right now I have been using it since July 9th, and it is the 17th at time of writing this. I have 32% battery left. 10 days is likely accurate.BONUS: although it says that it does NOT have ECG app for AFIB detection, it does. Sorta. ""while it can't take an ECG like the more expensive Fitbit Charge 5 or newer smartwatches, it will monitor your heart rate and alert you if it detects an irregular heart rhythm"".WATCH BAND STYLE: I wish I noticed this or thought to ask before purchasing. This has the PIN release style watch band. Since I like to swap out my bands frequently, I am not a fan of the pin style. Made extra annoying as this is a small unit and therefor extra small pin system. That being said, I havent had any real problem swapping out. Mostly just a nuisance. However, I went ahead and ordered a Charge 5 because that has the push button release. I like how the Fitbits are now just including a size small as well as a size large band size. I have 7"" wrist, and prefer the large band over the small. Gives me more wiggle room. I also like the regular traditional watch band style (slots with pin, then slip through securing band-- like any old school watch). Some models use a slip through  band which always made me think it was unsecure. So I always just bought new bands of preferred style. Overall I can wear this just fine as is.WORD OF CAUTION:The 4 star rating takes into account that I dont see in the description any info pertaining to the ""pin"" release style of band. Maybe I missed it. I also factor in that this CANNOT be used in conjunction with other models. I figured I could swap between the Charge 5 and this, depending on what I want to wear that day. Nope. This will have to be cleared from app before another one could use. I noticed this when I was putting this online to replace my Fitbit Sense. I had to deactivate the Sense to add this. And now that I have a Charge 5 coming, I will have to deactiveate this. I wanted to be able to try them out side by side to determine which I like most before giving one away. Boo/hiss.LASTLY, I decided to stop buying the smart watches, as in the Versa or Sense. I found that I wasnt using most of the additional features. None lasted more than a year or two for me anyway. This Inspire 3 and Charge 5 have all that I want, and nothing I dont. Comes down to personal preference. I have a Garmin Vivosmart that has lasted forever, but it never seems as accurate for basic movement (good for intentional exercise), basic walks, and the app is yuck. Whereas I really like the Fitbit app. I like the product, but are basically throw away items for me (whereas my husband is still wearing his Fitbit Blaze from several years ago).I'll update if I experience anything worth sharing, especially if anything negative.",https://www.amazon.com/Fitbit-Management-Intensity-Tracking-Midnight/product-reviews/B0B5F9SZW7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1
Unknown,R2LYH299YJME04,Positive,"Fitbit Inspire 3 Health &-Fitness-Tracker with Stress Management, Workout Intensity, Sleep Tracking, 24/7 Heart Rate and more, Midnight Zen/Black One Size (S & L Bands Included)",4.3,4.0,"14,878","Summary - The Fitbit Inspire 3 is a very good fitness tracker. It counts steps, monitors heartrate and is even a sleep tracker. It has pretentions of being a smart device but don't be fooled. If you use this as a simple tracker that links to a smartphone to download results you'll be very happy with it. It's from a well known brand, has a decent battery life and good accuracy. If you want a smart device then buy an Apple Watch as the Inspire 3 won't do that properly and you won't be happy. I like it but know it is limited and I'm happy with that.Pros - Battery life. This will depend upon how you use the device. I have turned off all of the notifications and other stuff. I link the device to my phone once or twice a day for a few minutes and I don't compulsively check the screen. In this minimalist fashion I do manage 10 or 11 days between re-charges. That's very good for such a small device and I don't have to remember to recharge it every night so I'm happy too.Accuracy - It's pretty good. Steps correlate with other devices as does heart rate. Sleep tracking is reasonable and apart from a well documented tendency to confuse deep sleep with light sleep it is consistent. These devices are only indicators and not proper medical devices. If you have sleep problems then a proper sleep polysomnography is what you need. But this is good enough. I've never been able to tell what the sleep score properly correlates too though. There are days when I can have a great sleep score and feel tired by 10:00am. it's just a number not a way of life.The indifferent - The screen is small and the choice of displays isn't very good. I found one that works for me and I see no reason to change it. The screen is bright but very small. Another reason not to think this is a replacement for something like an apple watch.Fit - the Inspire 3 comes with two soft, silicone straps. It is comfortable to wear. Just be advised that the device needs to be tight to the wrist to get proper readings. It can slip to a loose position and not be able to measure anything. This means that you'll get maybe 9 out of 10 nights of sleep records then a junk one. And, if you're lifting weights in a gym it will be useless for heart rate monitoring in those conditions. Otherwise it's fine.The Bad - Only to a phone? My old fitbit used to link to my desktop where I could use a large display to see the data. New ones like the Inspire 3 only link to phones. This is a problem with getting older but why do I have to look at a tiny screen (my phone)? Guess fitbit couldn't be bothered to maintain the desktop software.Fitbit Premium - aka the ""con"". So fitbit want to charge you a monthly fee for premium features. How dumb do they think I am? I don't see any benefit to this and certainly not for a ""mere"" $9.99. Don't fall for this. The Inspire 3 is a relatively inexpensive device from a well known brand. it doesn't need the extras premium can give and you don't need to give Fitbit the money. It's just another wasted subscription draining your wallet.Conclusions - There is a lot to like about the Inspire 3 if you have the right mindset. it's well made, comfortable to wear, reasonably accurate and with good battery life. It is a good tracker. It's not a substitute for a proper smart watch even though Fitbit want you to think it is. If you're happy to let it be a tracker with limited contact with a phone it will meet your needs. And meet them well. As a tracker it's highly recommended. As a smart device with a premium subscription it's a joke. Recommended with use case caveats.",https://www.amazon.com/Fitbit-Management-Intensity-Tracking-Midnight/product-reviews/B0B5F9SZW7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1

I’m an audio  guy with too many TV’s and surround sound systems. I’ve learned over the years that when it comes to audio bigger is generally better with regard to sound reproduction. But my wife just remodeled our family room and told me no big speaker systems and I could only have four little ones. I’m not sure what she was thinking So I decided to try this soundbar and matching sub and rears. “That’s only four speakers.” I told her. To make it simple, considering the size of the speakers, their low power output and the overall room size they were acoustically tackling, I was impressed. Does a nice job filling the room with somewhat of a surround sound experience and quality sound reproduction. It’s still a soundbar and there is no getting around the acoustic limitations that imposes but my wife’s happy because the system is unobtrusive and doesn’t require separate monoblocks weighing a ton each to drive massive power thirsty speakers that she says are unsightly. So to sum it up, Good quality sound, small package size, easy to set up with the app, good volume and compared to what I usually spend, it’s good value for the money.

The ability to create phantom channels on the ceiling is impressive. Paired with an SW5 sub, the sound is perfect, embodying a movie theater experience.- Although I haven't mounted them on the walls or hidden the cords yet, they are stylish, modern, and fit nicely with the room's decor.- With minimal cords, the setup is theoretically stress-free in that regard.- Music is probably the highlight; just casually listening to music with these speakers will blow you away.**Cons:**The software needs significant updates to be less buggy. Let me explain:First, I have many wifi-connected devices in my basement: 15 Hue lights, a TV, computers, smart speakers, etc. None of them have problems connecting to the wifi (which is a 1 Gb mesh system). However, setting up the speakers via the app either failed to recognize the Bluetooth pairing or the HDMI, or both. It was very frustrating and took several attempts to get past that and onto the calibration section. By then, I was already not feeling great about the product.Next, the connection to the app would randomly disconnect and then refuse to reconnect, saying the network couldn't be found. This was again frustrating and caused more doubt about the purchase. I had to completely reset the Bluetooth and the hub and start all over again. After searching the internet for solutions, I decided to connect the hub via a LAN connection and hide the cords creatively. With that, the app connected every time without issue. I don't know if this is a 2.4 GHz issue or if the congestion of devices constantly blocked the hub from connecting. So, if you have a lot of devices connected to wifi, beware.After all that, there was more...My TV, a Sony Bravia X90L, would randomly switch from the Theater Quad to the TV speakers—sometimes immediately, sometimes after 5 minutes, and sometimes not at all. Sometimes, it would refuse to stay on the Theater Quad and switch to the TV speakers every time. At this point, I was ready to return the whole thing. I tried every kind of TV configuration to see what was happening. Because this product is so new, there is almost no literature on troubleshooting it. But after extensive troubleshooting on my end, I realized the culprit was the Theater Quad's HDMI CEC setting, which allows you to control everything from the TV remote. I don't know what combination is supposed to be active for this to work properly, but turning off this setting on the Bravia app solved the issue, and it never happened again. Having to use two remotes is something I'll have to live with until a software update fixes this.After solving these issues, the product has run flawlessly, and I've decided to keep it. However, I was very close to returning it due to these problems, which I had to solve on my own.**Conclusion:**It took a lot of effort to get this system running properly, but once it did, it was worth it. It's pricey, but the immersive experience keeps me satisfied. Based on the design alone, it's not like you can easily swap it out for something similar, so I was hooked on that aspect as well.",https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Theater-Surround-Speakers-Supports/product-reviews/B0CZ7MGY3H/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1

I grew up with the original GameBoy, GameBoy Color, GameBoy Advanced, and finally the GameBoy Advanced SP. That should give you some idea of my age. Even wearing glasses, the 7"" screen is too small for most text. I like RPG's and story based games, and the text is often not optimized for the smaller Switch screen.Finding cases is about impossible. Maybe there are more now, but in 2022 I had to improvise because there were almost no cases that the OLED would fit in. I purchased a padded sling bag and added extra foam to prevent damage if dropped.The battery dies VERY fast. You pretty much have to be next to an outlet if you're gaming longer than 2hrs... maybe if you sat in the dark and turned the screen brightness down.The screen scratches about as easily as an old school CD or DVD. I had to wait for my screen protector to be delivered and played the Switch for a few days, kept it in a padded case when not in use, AND it got a small scratch on the screen.It struggles with ports.

But on the 15th of December was when I wanted to purchase games on my new console I went to go get my device it was at 50 percent when I put it on the charing doc when I go get the device it's at 22% battery I tried different wall outlets same result. Also the right joystick is a bit more losse the the left joystick when attached to the console. I don't know why I'm having these issues when I didn't buy a used device I spent almost 400 dollars on a brand new device just for my stuff not to work properly.Btw for anyone looking to get an Nintendo switch i did some reseach when your charging doc is blinking rapidly when plugging the ac adapter it doesn't work AT ALL!! It's supposed to be a soild green light no blinking.But another thing is that when I was playing my game on the nintendo the background where there was nothing black as it is suppose to be but however when i started to play more i started to notice the black was beginning to be more green and was 3 hours into playing just imagine how it is now and also the device is very slow when loading the shop or anything most definitely a delayed respond and this was before I purchase any games just imagine now and even when I'm playing offline it's lagging on a game that isn't multi-player. Thanks Nintendo....🙄 overall my experience when using the device itself hasn't been the best but the games make up for its short comings alot of short coming might I add...😒😮‍💨Update on May 6th 2023So this is the first time I have ever using the hdmi option because I wanted to play with nintendo with others. But turns of even with a third party device the hdmi doesn't work either. I tried on different tvs  with the same result allow me to mention again this is the first time I ever decided to use the hdmi option so there isn't any reason for it to not work. But btw even with me trying it with original or third party hdmi cables and docs the result is still the same the tvs that I tried recognizes the hdmi cable is plugged in but still there I'd no signal. So this means the problem is with the nintendo, but also guess what ... 🤯😒🙄 others customer are having the same problem. Imma be real honest I 1000% regret buying the nintendo switch I should have returned it but since I've had it for so long it's too late. But also keep in mind I got this device either in January or December but not counting latest time when I tried to play the device which is today and yesterday but the last time I played on this device was in February. This is going to be the last time I do an updated review on this device, but for you Nintendo I'm so disappointed. I've been a fan of nintendo since I was a toddler remember having older nintendo console and either 9 or 10 years old getting the dsixl, great devices with amazing games along side with it. But the nintendo switch worse device you ever made in my opinion so many problems to troubleshoot, and so many issues that can't be fixed so you either get a new device or go to their competition aka steam deck.Things to note:Since I have been a fan of nintendo from when I was young to now. The devices from when I was younger were more durable and more childproof aka the nintendo device could take a beating but with the nintendo switch it doesn't having that feeling of durability so be careful because this device is expensive. I never dropped or damaged the switch in any shape or form but just trying to form an understanding to those reading about how the device feels in my hand and the problems that I stated in my earlier review about the device and also the joysticks.",https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-OLED-Model-White-Joy/product-reviews/B098RKWHHZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1

Until the controller started its widely know and widely documented “drift.” In my case it was a nintendo pro controller - the joy cons are too small for my hands and give me repeated stress injury so I use the larger pro controller made by Nintendo for Switch. But all over the internet you can find fix it videos and instructions for the inevitable drift, whether for the joy cons or the pro controller. Seems Nintendo may repair the Joy Cons drift issue for free but not the pro controllers.The fact that it has a commonly known name of “controller drift” tells you something.I have a decades-old PS 3 I still use from time to time and never had a Sony controller with drift. No PC game controller I’ve owned ever drifted.So what’s drift? The character/object you are controlling starts moving on its own with no input on your part. In my case, it was downward on the screen.  Link, standing on a ledge, suddenly just walks off the edge and dies. Forget about precision movements.It worked great for almost a year. But the darn thing is expensive and I’m not buying another just to last awhile till the next one drifts. Fix it and maybe I’ll get another Nintendo someday.

Simply put, this console is designed for kid's hands. It is astoundingly uncomfortable to use for more than very brief (around 5 minute) sessions. Games that require the right stick are basically impossible to play in handheld mode, because you have nothing to hold onto and therefore your right thumb uses the right stick as a sort of handle. If that stick has any function in the game (like angling the camera), hitting the shoulder buttons will cause your thumb to move, moving the camera. That is a very common control scheme in first- and third-person perspective games, so in these games aiming is virtually impossible.You can also play it docked using an included controller harness, but it is very narrow, forcing my wrists into an uncomfortable angle. I can play games that use the right stick though, but not for long. This controller harness gets uncomfortable after around 15 minutes. Everywhere I've read online recommends buying a Pro Controller and a case with handles to alleviate this terrible design. That adds around $100 to this product's price.Is it worth it?Not really. The Switch was underpowered when it was brand new, and now (7 years later?) it is even more out of date with modern gaming standards. As a portable, that's forgiveable, but they really need to chop the price in half or possibly include a few games and the necessary ergonomic accessories that are 100% necessary to enjoy this thing. It has an OLED screen but it's not super impressive. It's a cheap OLED that doesn't support HDR or high refresh rates (not that I imagine any games would take advantage of either), so it's merely decent but nothing incredible.In order to play online games, you must subscribe to an online service, but it's way behind even the now quite ancient Xbox 360's online service. You can't do voice chat. It's laggy. The system itself was designed with online as an afterthought. Most multiplayer games are peer-to-peer, so what exactly are you getting for your money? Some ROMS from earlier console generations. The entire online multiplayer thing should be free, gating this behind any fee given how bad Nintendo's service is, well frankly it's insulting.In short, this is incredibly overpriced for what it is. It's too uncomfortable to use without $100 of accessories, and going online will cost you $20 - $60 per year. Games that came out a decade ago cost $60 (they just keep re-releasing games from the WiiU), and the price point for new games is $70. It's a total waste of money, but the only legal way to play  modern Nintendo games, which are quite fun.I wish Nintendo would just get out of the hardware game and focus on games, like what Sega did in the 90's. They aren't making good hardware products anymore.",https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-OLED-Model-White-Joy/product-reviews/B098RKWHHZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1

I OWN SIX SWITCH GAMES, THEY'RE ALL MAJOR TITLES, AND THEY ALL SUCK RIDICULOUSLY BAD.... THIS IS HORRIBLE! AND I AM NOT EVEN OVER EXAGGERATING.For example.... The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild makes you cross—dress Link in women's clothing just to enter a town full of women that ""forbid any men from entering the town. The games on this POS have made me want to throw this console at the wall so many times that I have become majorly concerned for my mental health.Trash graphics, uncustomizable system, many games lack the basic options that today's games have like camera invert controls, and wow, their games are basic asf. I am so frustrated with this purchase that I have rage—tweeted to Nintendo with earth-scorching complaints so many times that I'm surprised that they haven't blocked me.Look.... I livestream all the time, and every time I'm gaming on my Livestream with a Nintendo Switch, no one wants to watch. SERIOUSLY, NO ONE GOVES A FLYING CRAP ABOUT A NINTENDO SWITCH LIVESTREAM. I have 0 viewers when streaming with a Switch. I WISH I WAS JOKING.I don't understand how people keep saying this is a great gaming console, because it's not. It's trash and it's getting returned for a refund. I bought a PS5, Xbox Series S, and now this POS Nintendo Switch, and after my experience with all of these systems, I can only recommend that people stay VERY far away from a Nintendo Switch. I can't even stand this thing.I WOULD NEVER LET MY KID OWN A NINTENDO SWITCH, THIS IS ABSOLUTELY NUTS. What an overpriced POS. My suggested retail value of a Nintendo Switch is no more than 50 bucks, that's how awful of an experience this console gives its fans.Their controllers are complete trash too. It comes with this joycon handheld gaming controller connector thing, and you can't even plug your headphones into it. If you're a wired headphones user like me, you will be so outraged that your wired headphones absolutely have to be plugged into the Switch itself. Not to mention that the right controller struggles to stay synced to the console when disconnected from the console, and causes uncontrollable stick drift. I like gaming with wired controllers for peak performance, and I'm so unimpressed with the Switch controllers. When you hold the Switch with one hand for a second, you can feel the weight of the console might break the joycon controllers off of the Switch itself, it's that flimsy of a connection.The shipping was fast, but this was a terrible investment. A complete waste of money. And they're charging 60 bucks for these trash games too? I am baffled at how more people aren't complaining about what this company is getting away with. This is highway robbery! I am never buying a Nintendo product ever again. 👎🏻 Did I mention that the games are stupid? 🤢 When you buy this piece of junk, you're basically paying for a touch screen console that still needs the controller to operate the system and games, even though it's touch screen.For the price of the 3 games I bought and system itself, I could have purchased an Xbox Series X instead and not had all these problems. This is a system for kids, not for someone who's trying to take their livestream career seriously. This console is a joke and I do not recommend. 0 stars if I could.",https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-OLED-Model-White-Joy/product-reviews/B098RKWHHZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1
Unknown,R2QULZNAWOV218,Critical,Nintendo Switch (OLED model) with White Joy-Con,4.8,3.0,"37,081",I love the idea of portable gaming and have not played video games in 20 years. I bought  Doom eternal as it used to be one of my favorite games as a kid.1) downloading games : I dont like this idea as its not transferable for another person in your household to just play at their leisure unless they want to completely under your login with their own separate profile form their Nintendo account. This idea is a huge fail to me. your profile and gaming experience/ progress should be completely clouded and seamless.how nice would it be to just log in on any switch and have your stuff ready to go as long as they had the same games. in my opinion they missed big on this.2. The support for these games are lacking. there are software crashes and no one seems to be able to help with logging the crashes and actually patch fixing the bugs. so i have a downloaded game that i spend 3 hours playing a master level that crashes at the end of that level. I have no saved progress and am forced to start all over. what a crappy experience when you play games as an adult to relax.3. the games are extrodinarily expensive. i am unimpressed with the price and once again if you download these games there is almost zero chance everyone in a household with separate consoles can enjoy the game to its fullest. they are going to want to save their progress on their own console. big thumbs down.4. the oled is great for using with a monitor or by standalone with a separate controller. holding it and using joycons is too big imo for someone with even large hands. they are so far away for a heaving controlling game like doom eternal.5. the speed is a little slow for high pace games and would have liked it to handle 120fpsfor the price i can only recommend if you plan on having a mostly mobile gaming experience as the price is not competitive with larger fixed gaming platforms for the reasons listed above.,https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-OLED-Model-White-Joy/product-reviews/B098RKWHHZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1
Unknown,R1W5JKYAOIKSMP,Positive,Nintendo Switch (OLED model) with White Joy-Con,4.8,5.0,"37,081","This moderate upgrade of the Nintendo Switch is definitely worth spending an extra $50 to get if you are already in the market for a new Switch. The most important question though, is if it's worth it for the people who already own a Switch. This depends a lot on personal preference as well as how old your current switch is (and if you own the original HAC001 from 2017-2019 or the V2 that released in late summer of 2019). I mostly play in handheld mode because that is what this console excels at, for playing on a TV/Monitor, there are plenty of better options.So what do you get with this OLED model? You get a larger screen that is OLED instead of IPS LCD. This is the type of screen that most iPhones have used since 2017 (and all of them use it now except for the SE2). You get a better contrast ratio, meaning deeper blacks and brighter colors/whites. There is no HDR support like Dolby Vision or HDR10, but it still looks leagues better than all the other Switch models. The smaller borders around the screen make the device look more modern and it's the size they should have gone with from the beginning (even if the logistics of using OLED wasn't feasible in 2017). There is also improved speakers, they do sound better and make the games your playing sound larger and more immersive. It's not as big of a difference as the new screen is to the old screen, but it's still a good thing to include.Another new features is a better kickstand that is more like that of a Surface Pro tablet, allowing the Switch to be able to lean all the way back and be much more sturdy while doing so. This isn't really important unless you play in tabletop mode, but this is more realistic of a way to use this console with the screen being just that much bigger, I could see myself using a Pro controller and sitting the switch down for certain types of games.The last difference here is the dock, which has a built in Ethernet port, which you should really use if you have the option to go wired. Unlike in the previous model ""regular Switch"", a wired connection is basically twice as fast as using standard WiFI, before it was only about 1.5x as fast. It still is unfortunate that you cannot achieve 100Mbps download speeds, but 60-65 is better than the 40-45 I was getting on my older model.If I had to oversimplify who should buy the OLED model, I would say that these two types of people should buy the OLED (even if they already have a Switch Lite or V2) It would be: techie people who are nerdy about their tech and want the best they can get (even when they don't need it), and serious gamers who sink hundreds and hundreds of hours into playing the Switch in handheld mode.Also, I don’t know that we need to specify this anymore because the switch OLED has largely been in stock since early January. But I did not and would not pay one penny more than $350 (plus tax) for this console. I think it’s worth that price if you love Nintendo characters/games, but I don’t think the hardware is worth more than $400 and the tax gets it pretty close to that.",https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-OLED-Model-White-Joy/product-reviews/B098RKWHHZ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1

Unknown,R3EKLFVBUJOMYE,Positive,Nintendo Switch (OLED model) with White Joy-Con,4.8,5.0,"37,081","First, to be clear, I play exclusively in handheld mode.  (No proper technophile allows a video game system to be connected to their 4k tv if it does not output 4k. LOL!)  I am also a console (Xbox) gamer and have been playing video games since the mid 1980s.With that being said, this device is shockingly awesome.  Why?  You can basically play games with the graphically fidelity of almost (but not quite) the Xbox One/PS 4 in your hands.  This blows me away.  The fact that I can play NBA 2k, FIFA, Need for Speed, Grid, Mortal Kombat, Puzzle Quest and so many other games on the go is truly a joy to behold.  As a result, much to my surprise, this has been the console I have ended up playing the most.  It's easy to see why - I can take it with me wherever I go.  I travel for work and personal reasons.  This is with me and I can continue playing my games on it.  Don't get me wrong, I still enjoy my Xbox experience and still play PC games as well.  They are awesome.  However, I notice I play this more because it can be on an airplane with me, in the bed, during lunch at work, when I travel, etc.  Then, sometimes when I get home, I may want to continue my gaming.  So it is racking up more hours than my Xbox and PC (which I certainly still enjoy).Then, the OLED screen is gorgeous.  I had an original Switch.  I absolutely love this screen, the brightness, sharpness and clarity.  Some games look totally different.  If you already have an original Switch, if you can, sell it (or give it away) and get this one.  I absolutely love it.  I even bought a 512GB micro SD card.  I am in a form of gaming Nirvana.  You will really enjoy this model.Finally, I do think that Nintendo is in a truly awesome position with the Switch.  I am not sure if Nintendo even realizes how close they are to dominating the video game market for decades.  Why?  Think about it.  As of January 2022 the Switch is the leading console with over 100 million units sold.  It really, at this point, needs one thing to finish off the competition for decades.  What is it they need?  Just a little more power.  If Nintendo creates a device that has the graphical and processing power of an Xbox One/PS4, can do 1080p in handheld mode, with a 7 inch OLED screen, (and 4k when docked) Nintendo will rule gaming for at least a decade.  Why?  1080p on OLED, at the handheld distance from the eye, appears almost as detailed as 4k at a tv watching distance.  With the processing power of the Xbox One/PS4, developers can bring tons of more of their best games (triple A titles) to the Switch.  So, a Switch that powerful, with a large number of triple A games on it and with a screen that good in handheld mode, the Switch's market share would crush the competition.At any rate, I digress.  If you are considering this device.  Get it!  Period.  The build is so awesome on this variant.  You will love it.I have to go now.  I have to play my OLED Switch - LOL!Also, the delivery from this seller was also good.

Unknown,R3UFXXNYTG0BJQ,Positive,Nintendo Switch (OLED model) with White Joy-Con,4.8,5.0,"37,081","I absolutely love the product. I had a spat when I got it. It didn't have a charger for the dock. However talking to Amazon Support they corrected it for me and I was able to get a charger off the store. With the Switch Oled, you not only are able to have a bit more vibrant colors, but the system itself has great battery life. I had the original switch and this is leagues better. I literally had the switch in my bed for 4 days playing off and on and within those 4 days the battery went as low as 30% and the charging happens fairly quick, not to mention you can dock it and play it while it charges on a big screen tv.SO IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT A SWITCH IS OR HOW IT WORKS LET ME EXPLAIN THE DIFFERENCES1. theres 3 versions- Switch (original one with a dock and can be played on a tv w/ a smaller screen than Oled)- Switch lite (the hand held version with no dock and can't be played on a tv)- Switch Oled (newest one, vibrant colors on screen, Larger screen, and has a tv dock)2. Games- The switch is one of the better nintendo systems that have more 3rd party games on it, although the selections are smaller than the Playstation and Xbox, the switch gives you versatility to not only bring it with you on the go to play games, it gives you the action to play with multiple people by separating the joy cons (controllers) and with that you can use each one sideways as a controller allowing two people to play and with multiple joy cons you can have a session of multiple people.-It has both digital and cartridge games. the cartridge games are very small, and they also have a fast install time. The games are very fun to play and have lots of multiplayer options. No full VoIP on the system but they have an app for cellphones to use.- the store usually has great deals on titles as most of the cartridge games cost full price or barely have anything discounted at places like Target, Walmart or Gamestop.3. How they work (docked versions)- a docked Switch connects to the TV, it allows the device to charge and you can play games as it charges on the dock.- it has a tabletop mode where you can play games on the screen as a tv. In other words you can still use a controller but have the tablet part standing upwards as you use a full controller to play on it.- Handheld is where the Joy cons are attached to the tablet and you use it like a handheld or similar to a gameboy or something in that way.Personally it's worth the money and Nintendo has usually very good systems that last a long time.

Do you remember the Star Trek movie where the nasty green bug is put into the prisoner's ear?  If so you will understand.  I have narrow ear canals and found that the medium ones which it comes fitted with were a bit too large.  It was difficult to get them removed and yes I followed the directions and watched video on how to do it.  One of them came off finally so put the small one on, again as directed.  I put it in the ear and it felt odd.  I removed it and you can guess what happened:  the bud cover remained in my ear canal.  Thank heavens someone was home to help me get it out because I was seriously panicking!  In 25 plus years of wearing ear buds, I have NEVER had this happen.  If it had, I would never wear them again because obviously ""yuck bug""!The ear bud covers themselves are very odd.  They are very thin and the one I couldn't get off felt as if it would rip if I pulled harder.......which is good given that the one I changed felt secure and basically fell off in my ear.  There are only 3 pairs total, small, medium and large.  With this price point I anticipated more covers as with my Masters & Dynamic earbuds there were several pair in each size.  I can see why they don't want you to change the covers often but even with cleaning, my experience has been that eventually you need to replace them and here you would need to purchase another one in your preferred size.  They simply don't compare to my M & D ones at all.I waited on the charging case to turn green which again per instructions would mean they were both fully charged.  It ended up with only one charged and the other one completely dead.  Again comparing them to the M & D ones the case is simply inferior.  On mine there is a light for each ear bud and one for the case itself.  That way you can see if all 3 pieces have a complete charge.  You can also tell from the app the percentage of charge remaining which is a handy favor.  (I don't know if the Samsung app provides that information or not because didn't get to that point, but it should show on the case itself.)  The case is okay.  It doesn't feel nearly as sturdy as my M & D ones, nor does it look anywhere near as good.  I really don't care how it looks if they work, but it is a nice feature to have a case that looks like an expensive car does, one which you can immediately tell by the look and the feel that it is extremely well made.My security app on the phone identified the Samsung app as being dangerous, so I am going to uninstall it immediately.  Samsung usually does well with its app.  It was only because I have loved my Samsung phones, watches and televisions that I decided to give these a try.  The ear buds sound like they have potential but are not up to the standards I would expect as the ""pro"" version from Samsung.I have lost feeling on the ends of some of my fingers due to nerve damage in my neck which is why I have stuck with M & D for years.  They have wonderful mechanical buttons which I can easily manipulate.  I was willing to give these a try because while not mechanical it wasn't the universal one button which I hate as I can never tell if I have pressed it the requisite number of times and end up advancing a chapter, turning them off, ending a call, etc.  These may be wonderful but as I knew I was returning them I didn't take the time to figure out the controls....plus to be honest I didn't want to put them back in after the bud cover came off!I spent hours yesterday reading reviews because I couldn't decide which pair to try between the Samsung, Bowers & Wilkin and Sony.  I like to purchase on prime days or other sell days because of the cost.  As I loose things all too often, I try to get the best price I can.  Having really good hearing and blessed with the curse or gift of hearing anything that is out of tune, I found early on that I detested cheap ear buds.  I still love my Shure buds that are wired, but it is a pain to have the dangling cord all the time.  I paid a fortune for them in 2000 and they still sound better then any blue tooth ones I have ever tried, but I figured that would be the case.I listened to the sound on the charged one but that is not a fair test so I am not commenting at all on the sound.I think Samsung has the right idea, but in going for so many features, they have skimped on some elements and cut corners on the basics which you need to make any of the rest of it worth your time.  I may try again if changes are made but right now these fail.  I mean when the case shows green you would assume both were charged and that failed, you can see there are going to be issues right away.",https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Cancelling-Optimization-Interpreter-Redesigned/product-reviews/B0D9YZJ3V7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1

My hope was that the charging ports being on the stem would protect me from the ear infections.  Long story short: it did not.  It took about one week of typical usage before I started experiencing first itching and then burning.  I stopped using them at this point, but by morning, my ears were ""leaking"" (Again, those who know, know).  So, it appears that Samsung still chooses to ignore the verified issue with their building material.  I suspect its the powder coated grills for the mics on top of the buds and in the bud cannal itself.  I dont think its the tips since people change those and still get the infection regardless.  Well, anyway, for those of you who are affected by this, I took the leap so you dont have to; they absolutly do cause the same ear infection.  And for those of you who think ""just clean the tips"", please stop; it has nothing to do with that, but rather it is the material they use in the build.  So, I am returning them.Now, as far as the buds go:  for the weak I used them.  They sounded great!  People said my voice quality was great too, and very little background noise.  One person said my voice sounded muddled, and I was in a quiet location... so not sure what that was about.  The ANC is pretty good, but it severly lacks on blocking high tones.  I had sonys that did awesome on highs and lows, and these are noticable less capable than those.  But what I really loved was the feature set it offers with a galaxy phone.  So, if you dont suffer the alergic reaction that Samsung continues to ignore, then these are decent overall buds excelling in some areas and lacking in others.

I loved how they would read out your text messages so you don't have to pull out your phone to read your text messages. The sound is absolutely amazing! I'm a big bass head and they really pack a punch. I can care less about the blade lights, don't really use them. They are pretty comfortable to wear just like the Airpods Pro but even lighter in weight. I didn't use the translate feature that much but I could see for someone else, it could be very useful. Time to break down the cons and the biggest one for me is the battery life. It is complete garbage compared to other earbuds that are way more cheaper. You get at least 2 1/2 hours with the buds and the charging case sucks too. I only get 3 complete charges when the case and the buds are fully charged so I'll have to charge them everyday before heading out the door. Another huge con has to be the ear detection for noise cancelation. They really need to be more sensitive when in your ears. I've tried using the medium and large tips and still have the same issue. I have to constantly keep pushing them deeper in my ears because the noise cancelation mode would switch to normal if they are not fully secure. So talking, smiling, working out, and pretty much anything that involves pushing out the buds completely ruined it for me. The last con I have is the design. I don't why they went with this triangle shaped stem but they can cause functioning issues. There are multiple times I will pinch the stem to pause my music or answer a phone call and they will not work the first time. I know they were trying to avoid a design similar to the Airpods Pro but I think they should've kept the stem round as well. It just feels super awkward when pinching. These buds are completely overpriced and definitely need some software updates to fix the ear detection and touch controls. Hopefully they'll fix those issues woth the new gen but I'm staying away from Samsung buds for a while and use buds that have physical touch controls.",https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Cancelling-Optimization-Interpreter-Redesigned/product-reviews/B0D9YZJ3V7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1

Unknown,RKGADL0D49S45,Positive,"SAMSUNG Galaxy Buds 3 Pro AI True Wireless Bluetooth Earbuds, Noise Cancelling, Sound Optimization, Real-Time Interpreter, Redesigned Comfort Fit, Silver [US Version, Amazon Exclusive 2Yr Warranty]",4,5.0,190,"Just a quick aside to start, over the past decade I have owned the following in-ear buds (in no particular order):-Bose QC (Gen 1)-Galaxy Buds Pro (Gen 1)-Sony XM4-Sony XM5For starters, the fit is an improvement over my Buds Pros (and every other stemless design I have tried). Like, not even in the same league. Due to the stem and silicone tips, every few hours I'll catch one wanting to slip out. Small downside for decreased ear fold discomfort. I wear these all day at work- more on that later- and after my ears adjusted to the new shape for a week or so, I can wear them hours on end pain-free.Touch controls are likewise the best I have ever found on in-ear buds. Pinch and tap stem are dead reliable and the swipe up/down stem for volume is intuitive and works flawlessly. The triangular stems with large, flat surfaces are instantly locatable and wonderfully usable. Stemless buds cannot compare to the ease of use.The buds look, and feel, premium. They better, at this price point. I don't get the case gripes, but maybe that's just because I recently retired my XM5s and their famously flimsy case for this pair. Survived a drop or two from pocket height, once on hardwood and once on concrete. Small scuffs but the hinge is still rock solid and no cracks.Connectivity is phenomenal, though this will likely only apply to folks inside the Samsung ecosystem. Can see case and buds battery info from my Watch 6 Classic, and buds autoconnect on case open to my Z Flip 5 even if my bluetooth is currently toggled off (can be disabled/changed in Galaxy Wear settings.) Got maybe a good 25, 30 feet of range before connection diminishes noticeably, worse obviously if you've got walls in the way.Sound quality is great, bordering fantastic after you finally burn them in. I only say that because no in-ears will compare to something like a true pair of studio monitors etc. High budget audiophiles I'm sure could pick things out to you but the in-app equalizer is great and to my ears the highs are crisp and not tinny, the mids are well developed and you can dial up a surprising amount of bass through the equalizer, and I never experienced buzzing or washout. Very good listening experience across every genre I've tested.Now, nothing is perfect, right? Battery life is a little short with ANC active, it runs out on me with about 2 hours left in any given shift when the XM5's would get me through some full days. No big deal, 10 minutes in the case and im good for the rest of the night. My only true gripe would be with the noise cancelling. At times, it rivals the best I've experienced (for my money the XM5s,) effectively blocking most noise of all frequencies quite well. Uber trips, shopping, walking in public spaces, waiting at the train station etc they perform quite well. However, I work specialty service and in my shop I basically have to both work with heavy steel grinders and be able to field phone calls with clients/speak to customers in shop. When I'm standing and working on my machine, the ANC will be humming along smoothly when suddenly some frequencies stop being blocked, if that makes sense? All will be quiet, then suddenly through one earbud I will pick up certain sounds as louder than the other ear as they evade the ANC's processing. It's quite disconcerting to be honest, I'd almost liken it to feeling a pressure change in your ear but without the physical sensations. Some times it's better/worse than other times, but I'd say by and large the ANC holds its own. If every other point in my review is a 5/5, battery life is a 4/5 and ANC is (currently) a 3.5/5.I would hope to, and assume to, see the problems with ANC addressed with future software updates. For now, as an early purchaser that understands products almost never release in a perfect state, I am very pleased with my purchase and do feel that I got my money's worth.",https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Cancelling-Optimization-Interpreter-Redesigned/product-reviews/B0D9YZJ3V7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1

I'm coming from a pair of Airpods Pro (2nd gen), which I really like.  Main reason for replacing is that I've gotten tired of not being able to change certain settings since I'm not an Apple user.  These sound great, just as good as Apple if not better.  I'd say the ANC is about the same, which both do a great job in that department.The fit, like all earbuds, can be hit or miss depending on a person's ears.  They come with 3 sizes.  I found the largest ones to fit snugly in my ears.  Most of the negative reviews that I've read are from people who weren't able to find tips that fit their ears.  If they don't fit snugly, sound quality and ANC won't be very good so fit is critical.I wear these mostly for sleeping.  I tried several top brands and none were comfortable when sleeping, which is why I landed on the airpods about a year ago.  These are very similar.  They might extend out just slightly more, but work very good for sleeping like my airpods.  The big advantage to these is that I can turn off ANC and Ambient modes to save battery life.  The airpods I could not turn modes off because I don't own an iphone.  This results in longer battery life and gets me through the night.In summary, I would definitely recommend these.  My son bought a pair of silver buds and I have the ones in white.  We are both very pleased with sound quality, ANC, and the different settings that you can select.  One thing I would recommend if you get these is to adjust the EQ.

Am writing this review on sept 21 since first using these earbuds. Am glad I still waited on these because for the price am pretty satisfied with the sound clarity and comfort. Real quick to setup and connect to my s23 plus.Personally I don't like using the noise canceling feature on headphones or earbuds, mainly because I find it to cause fatigue on my ears within about 30mins of use. However the noise canceling is pretty good. Not as good as the sony wf1000 mx4 I used to have, but pretty good to say the least. I find myself using more the ambient sound to hear others around me while listening to music. But if am just want to tune out I just have it set to off all together. In fact when I go out for walks I just have it off without noise canceling/ ambient. Just having the sound up can block outside great as is.In comparison, I had my sony wf1000 mx4. Personally, I though those earbuds were great on sound quality but not so much on comfort. Those that know, the sony mx4 earbuds used memory foam ear tips that expand on your ears and can cause fatigue as soon as you start using them. Had to use the small earbuds size to feel better on my ears. But it was unpleasant. The sound quality and good bass was my favorite thing about the sony mx4 earbuds but they stop charging some time last year. And been using my back up razer chroma earbuds  waiting to see what samsung will put out on the buds 3. Am pretty glad I did.My first impression on the galaxy 3 pros is the sound clarity, comfort fit, and the light weight they rest on my ears. The audio quality is great but I did prefer the sony better and bass. Battery life is great but of course is better if you leave the light bar on the sides off, but a pretty cool feature.I will say I do recommend playing with the eq settings. I personally did find the default eq a bit dull. I'm happy to share my eq settings but I don't think you need to make any big changes to make the earbuds sound a bit more vivid it needs to be. Everyone has their own taste when it comes to eq adjustments. But like I said before i don't think is something to make big changes to. I like to listen a bit of everything, classical, rock, metal, classic rock, rap, kpop/ jpop, country, phonk, jazz, Latin.Nevertheless, I hope this review helpsPs. If you plan to get these earbuds for a apple device, I don't recommend it because of codec support. I recommend researching more on your own if you don't know the difference with apple use of aac codec and android device LDAC/aptx codec. Basically apple devices don't support the same high res audio on Android devices.

I really like having that seal on my ears, and cannot achieve this at all. This was still an issue with Buds 2, but less so, and in that case, aftermarket foam tips fixed the issue. As of my writing this, there are no manufactured aftermarket foam tips available, though there are some vendors on Etsy who make them, and so I'll try those.For reference, I have the biggest non-custom US hat size (8), but the biggest tips are too big, and the medium tips are way too small.

With an upcoming extended trip planned, decided to pick up this little guy to have more juice on the go. It's the same dimensions except for being thicker and heavier.It charges a recent/current gen iPhone or Android phone 3 times fully from 5% (on the phone) plus a little more on the 4th try (good for Airpods?). While you can share in an emergency, if you are traveling I would just get each person their own. That way you don't have to recharge the powerbank every night.This item tends to go on sale regularly. At full price (currently $45 USD) it's a little steep in my opinion but still worth it if you need it now. If you can catch this on sale, don't hesitate.During the trip, it went through airport security without any issue and functioned flawlessly. I love that it can charge more than one item at once and can do USB-C to USB-C (or USB-C to Lightning).After the trip, I charged it back fully and let it sit for 3 months in a drawer. It still read 100% and worked flawlessly when used, so good for storage.As mentioned, I have the 10000 mAh version of this charger and the only thing I'm missing from the 10000 mAh is the slide out phone stand (which is a really nice touch). The bigger powerbank is also twice as thick and twice as heavy.Lastly, the travel case is a really nice touch. It's a padded mesh bag with a drawstring. It looks really nice and makes carrying the charger easy.Overall: I was impressed with the 10000 mAh, but I love the 20000 mAh. Being able to fully charge 3 times is a game-changer and the digital readout takes all the guesswork out.If you want a smaller powerbank, check out the INUI 10000 mAh version. It's cheaper, but also more portable. Better suited for taking to school/college in my opinion.

I felt compelled to write a review for this product because it truly is that good. There was no incentive for this review, and I am in no way affiliated with this company. I do happen to take think this is the best 20,000mAh power bank on the market by far, and I was surprised because I thought I was stepping down in quality since the price was lower than usual. I had been buying Anker in the past, but their prices were higher than ever, so I was looking for a cheaper bank that still did what I wanted, and oh boy did it. I love this little device. I keep it in my backpack always, and it never seems to discharge without me actually using it. It’ll stay at 100%, I think that’s because of the modern type of battery they used which at the time I bought this was pretty new and only in a handful of power banks, so I thought they were lying when I saw it in this one for such a low price.Best power bank I’ve ever had, hands down, and I got it because it was far cheaper than the others at the time I bought it. It charges devices faster than any power bank in similar price range. It says it is 20,000mAh capacity, but it lasts far longer than any other battery pack claiming the same capacity. It has a convenience flashlight that I’ve actually used a handful of times in a pinch. It can charge 3 devices at once, has two extremely fast USB type A ports, and even has a USB type C port that is still a fast charger compared to other battery packs, but is slower than the type A which are lightning fast. It doesn’t get that hot when charging compared to other high end battery packs. One unique feature is the USB-C that serves as input doubles as an output. This is super cool because every other charger that I could find at the time of purchase had an input which couldn’t output. It was purely an input. This power bank is also incredibly light for 20,000mAh, and fits in my pocket with my phone without being incredibly burdensome. I think it’s probably half the size and maybe a quarter to a third the weight of my first charger (from Anker many many years ago) which was supposed to be 26,800mAh, but didn’t last as long as this one.Not sure if this company replaces broken chargers but I would bet they do because it says they have a 3 year warranty. Anker will replace broken power banks basically with no questions asked within 18 months of purchase, and I had to use that one time, so if they replace them without making you prove you didn’t break it or whatever then this company has twice the warranty (at less than half the price at the time I purchased). I think that is why the battery bank is such high quality. They don’t want it breaking within 3 years, so they use the highest quality materials. It really is nice in the hand and you can tell it is high quality. Mine is barely scratched after being used and abused almost daily for so long now.I’ve had this product for at least a year now, I think longer, and I recently went to Hawaii and didn’t need to charge my Bose portable speaker or iPhone 12 Pro Max until the end of day 5 of the trip, and I used both frequently each day. The portable charger charged my phone like 4 times over as well as my speaker.Overall this is the best portable charger in this capacity range hands down, and I am a portable charger fanatic and have owned many mostly Anker power banks over the years.

In four years I've probably dropped it fewer than ten times, but it survived my clumsiness, possibly through its own merits. Mainly, I was surprised to find it was sufficient to charge my phone and headset multiple days each week, the exclusive source of charge during the days I used it for those two devices. I charged the bank only once a week in order to get this benefit, all the way up until this week in August of 2024 when it finally couldn't take any more of what I'd consider moderate use - and even then, ""couldn't take"" only means ""not the same way."" Still charges up to 30% overnight.I only paid so much for it last time and I'll only pay what they're charging for it this time. And I find it to be good value for money, under $10/year.

Unknown,R2X3BKIMDMYK85,Critical,"Amazon Fire 7 tablet (newest model) 7” display, read and watch, under $80 with 10-hour battery life, 32 GB, Black",4.4,1.0,"17,640","First, I want to give a shout out to Dyle, the Amazon customer service representative, who patiently and valiantly tried to help me with the issues I'm having with my new Kindle Fire 7.  He is phenomenal, and I'd give him 100 stars if I could.  Unfortunately, the overall rating is 1 (and I wish I could give it something lower) due to Amazon's product, and the very weak warranty period surrounding it.  I bought my first Kindle Fire 7 in 2013, and have absolutely loved it.  I used it everyday, primarily borrowing books from my local library.  The interface between the library and Amazon worked perfectly, and I downloaded over 1000 books during that time, all downloaded to my Kindle Fire successfully.  I decided this past August that I should get a new Kindle Fire 7, as the charging of my old one was getting slower and slower.  Big mistake on my part - I should have on to the old one.  Everything started out fine with the new Kindle Fire 7.  I continued my usual routine of getting books from my library, and they successfully downloaded to the new Kindle.  After about 6 weeks (halfway through the meager 90-day warranty period), the downloading function stopped working.  I got an error message saying that Amazon was working on the issue, and to try again later.  After about a week of continuing error messages, I thought I should contact customer support.  Well over an hour later with the representative, all I was told was that it must be an error at my library.  The error message indicating that Amazon was working on the problem certainly seemed bogus.  With the customer service rep, I was able to successfully download library books from my PC and my iPhone to the new Kindle.  So the rep also added that I should just use my PC or iPhone to download books.  Not a good answer, Amazon.  I bought the Kindle Fire 7 specifically for the functionality which allows me to, with only the Kindle, take out books from the library and download them.  And, obviously, the Kindle had proven that this technology should work, until 6 weeks into my ownership of the new Kindle.  I wound up speaking with an Amazon supervisor, who acknowledged that the issue was on the Amazon side.  She indicated she would open a case with Amazon's Software Engineering Department in order to resolve the issue.  She also indicated that I would be contacted by Amazon in about a week with a resolution.  I asked if I could call in, concerned that I may not get a call back.  I was told that I could not call Software Engineering.  This was not unexpected, I just wanted to talk with someone in Customer Service who would be able to tell me the status of my issue.  The supervisor said she would document this situation in detail in my account record, so if I did call in, I should be able to get a quick response.  Fast forward 10 days, I still haven't heard from Amazon, and my warranty period is quickly ticking away.  I called in, and got the wonderful Dyle to help me.  (I did not put him on the spot, but it seemed apparent to me that the supervisor I had spoken to previously did not document the issue, or at least not sufficiently for someone else to be able to follow). Dyle tried a number of troubleshooting ideas that neither of the first two representatives tried.  Unfortunately, none were successful, and through consultation with someone else at Amazon (I assume his supervisor), they said I needed to send my Kindle back and they would attempt to repair, or else send me a new one.  I asked if the warranty period starts fresh with the repaired/new Kindle, and was told that it did not.  So, in the time I waited, seeing if Amazon's error message was accurate (indicating they were working to resolve the issue), calling into Customer Service and waiting 10 days with no response from them, then sending my Kindle in for repair/replacement, I estimate I have lost about 30% of the already skimpy 90 day warranty period.  This is just not right.  The issue with the Kindle did not occur until owning it for 6 weeks.  If the same pattern repeats itself, I will be well beyond the warranty period when the issue occurs, and then I will just have thrown my money away on this Kindle.  Dyle (and his supervisor?), understanding my concern, offered a partial refund if I just wanted to return the Kindle.  Why partial though, Amazon?  It's been acknowledged that the issue is with the Kindle.  Why should I have to pay anything if you send me a defective Kindle?  Very bad business model.

When I got it in and it was smaller, I didn't mind the size, but was even more disappointed at the price.  Shame on you Amazon for charging $10 more for a smaller tablet only 2 model years later.  The price doesn't reflect inflation.That being said, if you want a cheap smaller tablet (I actually like the size myself) that does basic streaming and some games, maybe some kindle reading, this works fine.  However, do yourself a favor and mod it so that you can dump the unnecessary apps Amazon won't let you remove and install apps like google play since Amazon doesn't support their own app store.

Unknown,R2TMC6YVV0TR9C,Critical,"Amazon Fire 7 tablet (newest model) 7” display, read and watch, under $80 with 10-hour battery life, 32 GB, Black",4.4,2.0,"17,640","I bought the 16Gb and 32 Gb versions of this tablet. 1) The least bothersome aspect is that the speaker is of very low quality. Maybe I'm spoiled with my Samsung Zflip 3 which has amazing audio but this tablet has a really bad speaker. 2) The memory. The 16Gb and 32Gb are adequate. However the RAM for these tablets is sub-par. The 2Gb RAM is woefully inadequate for todays uses between streaming services, music, videos and books; all it takes is a bit of any of those used together and the tablet will shut down and kick you back to the main menu. 3) Using a tablet cleaner which is constantly running will also take up the RAM. I other words, use a cleaner/maintenance app that does not run in the background. The 16Gb unit has a 250Gb card while the 32Gb unit has a 1Tb card. Books from the Kindle app do not get sent to those cards. Instead, the books are dumped into the internal memory of the tablet. I have a few thousand books (over 12 years of collecting Kindle books) and this presents a serious problem in particular when the thumbnails for each book are taking up RAM. 4) Tablets these days should come with a minimum 4Gb RAM. This one only as 2Gb RAM which puts it in a very bad position for using memory intensive apps. Consider getting something else 5) Taking into consideration the Kindle app and it not downloading books to the external SD card, I made the attempt to remove the Kindle app and then re-installing it in the hopes that this action would correct the problem of the books not being downloaded into the SD cards. For some reason, Amazon has made it impossible to remove the Kindle app and re-installing it. I was able to do that with all of my Kindles but this is the first time I was blocked (on both machines). MY RECOMMENDATION: DO NOT PURCHASE this tablet until 1) The RAM has been upgraded to a minimum of 4Gb and the issue with downloading books to the SD card is resolved. This tablet is good only if you will be using it lightly like in only playing music (I'm afraid to put music on this machine) or streaming videos. Streaming takes negligible amounts of RAM. But having anything in this machine which will have to load into the RAM itself will present problems. Please note that I have owned approximately eight Kindle Fire tablets and many of them were really bad. So, for lite use, yes, it is fine especially if you use it with headphones or outside speakers. Everything will work fine. Just be aware of the issues mentioned above and if you are fine with those then get this unit. If not, wait for Amazon to upgrade it to 4Gb and resolve the Kindle books issue.",https://www.amazon.com/Fire-7-Tablet/product-reviews/B096WJFX8M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1

I tried all of the remedys that Amazon suggested, but to no avail. Last night I did a factory reset on the tablet which seemed to remedy the situation (fingers crossed).

In this price range you are not going to get eye popping graphics or symphony hall sound (it has mono output and speaker). But it does the basic job nicely and is simple to use. Initial setup was easy, if a bit slow. My big gripe about the setup was tapping through a number of nag screens that want you to install various Amazon Apps that I didn't need or want. But each one was easy to say ""No"" to and then proceed to the next nag.After getting it up and running, the Apps are a bit slow to load. I bought this primarily for listening to songs on my Amazon Music subscription. Here is where the glitches start. I occasionally get ""unable to play this song"" messages when I tap on a song. Going back to the Home Screen and restarting ""Music"" usually clears this up. I never have this issue on my iPhone or iPad, so it must be related to this tablet.  A much larger problem is that I sometimes will get a ""you need an internet connection to play this music"" when I tap on the song. WiFi is shown as connected and other Apps work, but Music will not play anything. Doing a shut down and restart will clear this problem up.The Bluetooth connected right up with my Bluetooth speakers and it seems to work fine and I've had no issues with the Bluetooth.The Ads that come with the cheaper model aren't too bad. They appear on the lock screen and a quick swipe up will banish them. There are also ads across the top of the Home screen, but they are not too intrusive and are easy to ignore. Thankfully, no jiggling or flashing ads that are difficult to close like you see on other devices.Overall, a pretty nice tablet. But I am keeping an eye on the Return date to see if I continue to have issues with with the ""You need an internet connection"" message. And, no, Amazon Support; I am not going to reboot my Gateway to attempt to solve this problem. Everything else I have in the house works just fine and glitch free on my WiFi - so it is some issue with this Tablet.

Stereo sound still is excellent, picture, etc....please bring it back.  sigh....This little baby will, however, be thrown in my purse for the little annoyances of life stated above.

For most users who had the previous version, the kicker is that your covers and cases etc. are no longer compatible.Also the Charger uses USB-C plug also which is different from the previous versions.In terms of performanceThis is night and day in comparison to the older versions.  The older version was slick when it first came out but like most people know, the FireOS is basically Android and as more and more updates have been applied, the older version is now running really slow. So basically this new version hardware was tailored for the today's version of android thus it runs very fast and very slick, this is a very crucial issue.NO YOUTUBE KIDS APPThe biggest issue anyone will encounter and is well known about is that this does not have the Google Play Store or accompanying services. That means that IT DOES NOT HAVE THE NATIVE YOUTUBE KIDS APP.There are many people on here that simply either don't understand what a native app is or simply confuse it with the main Youtube. I myself had multiple answers that failed to answer this basic question with multiple contradictory answers or reviews that failed to  understand the question.Amazon FIRE tablets DO NOT HAVE YOUTUBE KIDS Apps. Amazon has their own Youtube.com app which it seems they created as the developer email address for that app is an amazon.com email address. When you click YOUTUBE KIDS link in that app it jumps to the browser and opens in the browser which is a terrible experience. It is strange given that on the fire TV, the YouTube app allows you to switch to kids profiles, if only Amazon would do that for their tablet youtube app. But until then What you have are 3rd party apps built by you know who on the AppStore that plays youtube. They are not native apps, nor do they support most of the functionality as is. They are not written by Youtube, Google or Amazon either, so if you want to give those apps your google login which is used for Youtube Kids then you do so at your own risk.YES YOU CAN INSTALL YOUTUBE KIDS NATIVE APP, BUT YOU HAVE TO DO IT YOURSELF.I don't know why nor will I try to even get into this very very old topic of not having youtube kids, but the GOOD news is that it is very simple and easy to get Youtube kids native apps on this 12th gen version. You don't need to be a modder or anything intense. But a simple web search will tell you how to do this. Just know that you will have to install 4 different google apps/services first to get the Play Store. This is even easier as you simply open the browser, download each of them from the website and Click to install. DONE AND DUSTED.  Once you have the Play Store you can easily install any of the native youtube Kids apps or even the original Youtube app from google and even login to your tablet with your gmail account. I was able to do this in 30 minutes.With YouTube Kids installed. I am now able to give this 10 Stars.This is basically very decent hardware and latest OS for $60.You cannot go wrong with this as a kids tablet especially with the ability from Amazon to quickly lock this down.Touch Screen is extremely responsiveI have struggled to find a decent priced kids tablet that is responsive enough to use the ANTON app without lag. This is the fastest tablet I have seen at this price point. For those that haven't used ANTON, it is by far the best app for teaching your kids. It has school derived lessons, I would recommend every parent should download ANTON. But it's writing lessons, needs a screen that is responsive and a fairly decent tablet. This tablet passes the ANTON test with a gold star.Sound is clear with some bass. It doesn't sound like a tin can.Sound quality is very loud and clear. Trust me, if you've been through the dozen kids tablets I have, you will be surprised how much of a let down it would be when you have poor sound. Kids need to hear clearly and this does it without issues.The Amazon AppStore itself is actually pretty good. All the apps we had on our old android tablet were available except for Youtube Kids. I'd imagine there are many more that are not available but most of the decent kids ones are on there including ANTON, ABC Kids etcI would think that since the FireTV Youtube app allows kids profiles, that Amazon would at some point do the same with their own tablet Youtube app.As it is right now this table is almost perfect especially once I was able to manually install play store and youtube kids easily.

So this one is definitely a step up from that.  I just got tired of the Fire OS - it was too locked up and not as robust as regular Android.  Plus, there is one mindless Android game that I love that isn't available in the Amazon App Store, so that's a thing.I like to talk a lot before getting to the actual review.  Sorry.  Context is important for me.***Actual review***I decided to buy a new Fire because I wanted something a little larger than my phone screen (I have a Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 3, which actually has a pretty large screen) to watch movies on when on vacation.  Fires tend to be cheaper than most tablets, so I looked there first.  This came up with decent specs for an amazing price, so I bought one.  Then realized that it wouldn't be out until 6/29.I got it yesterday and set it up.  Here are my impressions:Kindle Fire 7 with 32gb storage & no ads.Pros - Perfect size to watch movies on an airplane tray table - Decent screen resolution (my eyesight isn't what it used to be, and this is still better than everything I had growing up) - Made for Amazon environment, so Prime Video, Audible, and Kindle books work great.  Mostly. - Most of the apps I use are in the Amazon Appstore - I paid $94 to get this without ads and to get the 32gb size - that's way cheaper than a comparable name brand tablet anywhere else (I'm looking at you Samsung & Apple!) - There's an expandable memory slot - I have a 128gb micro SD card in there (It makes you format the card before you can use it) - USB-C cord!!!!!!  I don't know when Fires switched to this, but I'm glad they finally did - Amazing battery life.  I downloaded a whole bunch of shows and also reset a couple of times.  Then downloaded again.  After several hours of aggressive usage, it's still at 66%.Cons - Wow, this is slow.  I'm comparing it to my phone, which is technically top of the line as of last November, and this is slow.  It's also $1400 less than I paid for my phone, so while it's annoying, it's not enough to knock off a whole star. - Can't fast charge.  Not a huge issue because the battery is pretty big & I have to sleep sometime, but still. - Can't download the one game I want from the Play store.  Yes, I know that there's a way to do it, but it's annoying that it's not easy out of the box. - Not all the customer service people know enough about this to help when you have issues.  (Yeah, technically not the unit's fault, but as someone who was DM'ing with them for 2 hours yesterday and talked with 4 different people, I'm putting this con somewhere!) - Can't save Prime Video content to the SD card.  At least you can't download there.  That's why I got the card.  I'm not sure I can transfer Prime Videos between internal & SD yet.  I think this is the same for all Amazon content. - I kept getting ""service_error"" when I downloaded tv episodes that I had purchased, even when the episodes weren't on another device.  According to Customer Service, you can only have them on 2 devices.  I only had them on one, and I deleted them off that one, and I still kept getting the error.TL;DR: This is a really, really good tablet, bordering on great FOR. THE. PRICE!  The form factor is awesome for travel, and as long as you play in Amazon's sandbox, the experience is mostly good.  I did have a lot of problems downloading episodes, which is actually why I bought this in the first place, and I don't like that you can't download Amazon content to the SD card.  I'm not sure if there are legal reasons for that, but I don't like it.",https://www.amazon.com/Fire-7-Tablet/product-reviews/B096WJFX8M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1

Unknown,RUKWEO8BE6M69,Positive,"Amazon Fire 7 tablet (newest model) 7” display, read and watch, under $80 with 10-hour battery life, 32 GB, Black",4.4,5.0,"17,640","I needed an e-reader which could handle my needs, and that's why I rated my Fire 7 highly. I'm not using it to play games or stream movies or take pictures and videos. Though I got the no ads/32 gig model, because reading is serious business.Because it was my six year old Kindle Paperwhite that got me into this. I love reading on it, even library books. This is important, because I'm a writer (The Way of Cats book) and a devoted reader. To keep up with this favorite hobby, I have a Kindle Unlimited subscription. Still, there are many books, and I also subscribe to Scribd. I have books I own, and books I rent, essentially.Which makes my Paperwhite less of a general reader than I would like. I'm also researching a new book. I can send all these PDFs to my Kindle account, but it's not the same reading or highlighting experience as an optimized PDF reader. In my mind, I'd like to keep these documents, but not on my Bookshelf, mixed with the thrillers and the sciences.Recent thoughts of how long my Paperwhite would last led me to consider e-readers in general. Reading outdoors is combining two of my favorite things, where a dedicated e-ink device really shines, so some kind of Kindle reader is important to me. But I could really use a general purpose reader. This was my first attempt at combining these needs. I am very pleased.The Silk browser, included, let me navigate to the address of the Scribd app (information on the Scribd site.) This let me download a third party app, permission for which I first adjusted in settings. Currently testing PDF readers in the Amazon App Store, for some free books I got in that format.Now I have three readers in one. My Kindle and Scribd books update on my other apps, and I them as I've always done. This screen is as easy to read on as my iPad mini, so no complaints. My iPad is bigger and heavier, with the case and the Pencil, and not something I put in my purse if I don't need to. The Fire 7 works better for what I usually need a purse device for, which is reading and web browsing. My phone is really old and won't keep downloaded books for very long. The idea being that if I'm stuck somewhere with no wifi, I have books in the device. And they will be there.The Kindle app is almost fully operational, but I can't put books into Collections with it, and the layout is subtly different, but it works fine. If it gets confused, I restart it. It's not a high tech device, but it's great for the price.",https://www.amazon.com/Fire-7-Tablet/product-reviews/B096WJFX8M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1

It's right around 3/8ths of an inch thick, and feels pretty light weight to me. Certainly light enough that it won't become heavy even after several hours of dedicated reading.It charges pretty quickly. Right out of the box, it had a 6% charge. Using the included cord and plug, it powered up to 100% battery in an hour or so, and each charge seems to last a good while. (This Fire tablet will also tell you how many hours and minutes of charge are left, presumably based on your current activity. I like this feature a lot.)Setup was easy, as it wasn't linked to my account since I bought from a 3rd party vendor (Best Buy). It took maybe 5 minutes, because there was an update that needed to install.Other than the size difference between this one and the 2019 version, some things are changed. Most important for me are the control buttons.The power button has been relocated from the right side to the left, which is going to take me some time to get used to but I will, eventually.  Whereas before, the buttons, from L to R, were ordered as Volume, Headphone Jack, Charging Port, Power, the 2022 Fire 7 is ordered (also L to R) as Power, Volume, Charging Port, Headphone Jack. I can't say it's better or worse. Just different.So far, this tablet operates well and opens/navigates quickly. That may (or may not) be because I only use it for reading and checking other books on Amazon's website.I hate the Silk browser, but it is what it is.I don't like that I can't uninstall any of the pre-loaded apps that I will never use, or even just remove the icons from my home screen (as far as I know), but that's a relatively minor thing.I've given this 7 inch 12th generation 2022 Fire tablet 4 stars due to the inconvenient things I mentioned above, but on the whole, I like it for what I use it for. I can't speak to heavy/very varied use. I would not try to use this for hardcore gaming.If you're looking for an affordably-priced eReader with light internet use, this tablet might just be for you.",https://www.amazon.com/Fire-7-Tablet/product-reviews/B096WJFX8M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1

This ismuchit's better! My only suggestion: be aware that it is slight smaller and lighter than than the 2019 Fire 7. Thus, you will need a new case. (I found a case similar to my original Fire case, much less expensive, a bit stiffer, but works similarly. It does not have the 'open to wake' front, but neither does my cell phone case!) I do feel the sound is not quite as loud on this Fire tablet but that is minor. All in all, a great deal!Edit: 10/6/2024Although this tablet remains faster than my former Fire 7 tablet, I must add that I have discovered some Cons:1. The phasing in of the new Gallery photo app is awkward. I greatly prefer the original Photos app. I simply dropped Gallery into an Unused folder.2. The Amazon storefront app is not as convenient for as it is no longer so intuitive. (I now find myself purchasing more items locally.)3. The 'bloatware' continues to be a nuisance, taking up valuable space. I wish it were Google compatible so that I could choose my apps.4. A basic inexpensive tablet, largely a marketing tool, it remains serviceable. IMO, my android tablet and phone better suit my needs. The SD card does not integrate well to extend memory.5. The Appstore security app offering have greatly diminished. I was actually told by Amazon IT that I should remove one as the store only sells them, does not guarantee their safety. I am aware that this is a problem recently with other play stores, etc. I was assured that Fire tablets are hard to hack. But many data systems have vulnerabilities.In summary, a well priced tablet for basic entertainment,  it has limits. I own 2 older models and this newer one. They interface well with Alexa. The clock app works even if WiFi drops and is a great alarm backup.

Most prints were basic Word documents with occasional color, so it wasn't heavily used.This printer is only a good fit for someone who rarely prints, and even then, I'd recommend starting with at least one set of backup cartridges on hand or investing in a higher-end model that will have longer-lasting ink.",https://www.amazon.com/Canon-Wireless-Printer-Document-Printing/product-reviews/B09CDXKNB9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1

Unknown,R2CYIPN7VTTYZB,Critical,"Canon PIXMA TR4720 All-in-One Wireless Printer, Home Use with Auto Document Feeder, Mobile Printing and Built-in Fax, Black",4,2.0,"10,732","I only gave this a couple of tries before deciding to return, so I can't say how it holds up over time.Right away I noted that the plastic seems thinner, lighter, and more flexible than my old printer (an old hp officejet). I worried a little but hoped for the best.Another gripe about the build:  in the pictures it looked like the paper was stored in a covered tray. This is what made me choose this printer over a very similar and somewhat cheaper machine that had the paper sticking up out the back. Well, the paper tray is not fully covered. I'm not sure why there's no paper sticking out in the product images. I still think the horizontal feeder is probably less likely to get damaged by dust and humidity than the sticking up the back type, but it's not what I had in mind.Setup was easy but would it really have been so hard to include a quick start guide in the package instead of making you open it on your phone? I mean the QR code worked fine and the online instructions were fine but I could have figured it out faster with a simple illustration or two.Wifi Setup was easy peasy and other than putting in ink and paper it didn't need anything else to be ready to print.First thing I did was print a test page of basic text from a Google doc on my phone. It transmitted efficiently. Then the printer let out an awful squeal and printed a page that looked like it came from 1999. I couldn't believe it, so I gave it another try, checked the settings (maybe I should have manually selected black and white instead of keeping it on color and letting it figure out that the text was black?) Still came out grainy and grayish. Then I printed the same thing on my old ailing hp (maybe the problem was in the document?) and it was a little fuzzy and streaky (this is one reason it's getting replaced) but definitely blacker and less pixely looking.I like having a color printer for those occasional projects and kid stuff, but most of what I print is black and white, usually text, sometimes with barcodes. If it's not going to be black and reasonably sharp, then never mind.I printed a color test page on each printer just out of curiosity, and it was much better. I almost couldn't tell the difference between the two. The text in the colored image was much sharper than the black text, you had to be paying good attention to see that it was still a little grainy, and the colors were similar enough though maybe ever so slightly richer on the hp.I sure hope the noise and poor text quality are a fault of this model and not a Canon habit, because I just ordered a different Canon to replace this. Because that one is evidenced on YouTube to really have a covered paper tray, and the similarly priced hp has the paper sticking up in back. But if the print quality is still poor then I'm going with the hp and will have to risk the exposed paper feed, because in essence I need my printer to print at least well enough. And preferably quietly enough to use while people are sleeping.",https://www.amazon.com/Canon-Wireless-Printer-Document-Printing/product-reviews/B09CDXKNB9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1

I've put their large copies into businesses, and used their smaller inkjet devices in my home.This particularly copier just embodies ""cheap plastic junk"" in so many ways that make it very frustrating for someone who has loved Canon products for so long. Among the things that are really sub-par about this device are the following:* The paper tray on the bottom sticks out from the rest of the unit, which is annoying. Previous models of various Canon printers I've owned have had a wide enough body that the paper tray fit completely under the printer. I would gladly trade the extra shelf space for having the paper tray not stick out from the printer.* The fact that the paper tray sticks out from the printer, combined with the fact that it isn't even a full tray, just a flip-down tray, led to it getting cracked and breaking off when someone pushed on it too hard.* The two-line LCD display is a step backward from the LED screens that previous products have featured. Configuring the printer, checking status and settings, etc., is made much more difficult with this display.* I'm not sure that going from separate color ink tanks to a single integrated color tank is actually a good step. The ink cartridge is significantly smaller, which means more frequent changes (and thus more wasted plastic), and you then end up replacing all of the colors at the same time whether you've actually used each of them or not. This seems incredibly wasteful, particularly since my experience with the individual color cartridges is that one of the colors tends to get used disproportionately to the others.",https://www.amazon.com/Canon-Wireless-Printer-Document-Printing/product-reviews/B09CDXKNB9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1

You have to do double sided printing manually with this printer. And the ink supply runs out pretty quickly. But it is a cheap laser printer. And most cheap laser printers have a limited ink supply.

And avoid recyclable or reusable ink cartridges. They can leak and ruin your printer.This printer is a good quality laser printer, despite the manual double sided printing.

The cord is detachable, but the cord doesn't seem to match the common AC cord (like what goes into my Xbox Series S). Like others have said, the display only shows track number when in CD mode. In radio mode, all you get is a small LED that lights when the system is on.Audio quality is middling at best. Lacking in bass and treble, it sounds like... a cheap radio. Again, I'm not listening for hi-fi, so it doesn't bother me too much. Discs spin up quick and the disc drive isn't too loud. On either side of the boom box are dials: left is for volume and right is for tuning. Tuning is a bit inconvenient as the only way to approximate your frequency is by looking at a disk used to tune. Personally, I prefer having a tuning dial since I find it faster and quieter than having a digital tuner. I live in the city, near radio transmitters so reception quality is decent. The buttons used to control CD playback have their function debossed and emit a clicking sound when pressed.Overall, this purchase is just OK. I thought I wanted a cheap, barebones CD player and that's what this is. I wish I had thought more about how the radio frequency would be displayed, but it's not a dealbreaker for me. Just make sure that you are really OK with a cheap CD player before pulling the trigger; else you might be rather disappointed.",https://www.amazon.com/Magnavox-MD6924-CD-Boombox-Black/product-reviews/B077VS8B4M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1

Unknown,R2ZHK1OTV3YX3R,Critical,"Amazon Fire TV Cube, Hands-free streaming device with Alexa, Wi-Fi 6E, 4K Ultra HD",4.5,1.0,"11,981","Update to below review:I hate this device with a passion that will never fade.  It'd be great if it worked, but it doesn't--at least not as advertised.I pulled the trigger and bought a receiver and speakers, so sound is resolved for my home theater, without any help from the Fire TV Cube.  But, I still have the Fire TV Cube, so I figure, OK, I'll hook it up and maybe..1) I can use Alexa voice control as a universal remote.  Nope.  After setup, it just doesn't work.  Nada.  Completely non-functional.2) OK, I've got an Apple TV and receiver to watch most of my content.  Maybe I can use this as another Alexa to stream Amazon Music, to which I have a subscription, to stream to the main level of the house.  Nope.  Crazy buggy.  The Fire TV Cube is in the ""main level"" room and all audio is supposed to stream on a set of devices, including an Echo Plus and a Stereo Echo Link.  But, where does the Fire TV stream to without any reason?  An Echo Flex.  You can't assign the Fire TV to the audio in the room, even though it is assigned to the room.  You can't even direct it specifically to the room.Junk! Junk! Junk!  These guys have no idea how to write reliable software.  ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA!I've had it.  I'm ripping it out because it is less than useless.  In fact, I'm heavily invested in the Amazon Echo ecosystem.  I'm out.  I will never buy another one of these devices and when I need or want something else, I'm slowly transitioning out.  Who?  I don't know, probably Apple.  More expensive? Yes.  However, their stuff mostly works and you can get decent support. Try to contact Amazon and you'll spend hours on the phone with a runaround.So, for the home theater I have Apple TV, a Denon receiver, Klipsch speakers, a PS3, and a Nintendo Switch.  Almost all my content is available through Apple TV.  If I need to use the Nintendo or PS3, I'll just pick up another remote.  I can turn on the entire system, turn off the entire system, and control volume through the Apple TV remote.  Most of the time, that's all I need, once everything is set up.  Do yourself a favor and just do what I did and get an Apple TV.  If you're happy with your TV audio you can even dispense with the receiver and speakers, or maybe get a sound bar.  Save yourself the money and the endless grief.Hate it.  Hate it.  Hate it.--------------------I suppose if you're going to use this as your main streaming device with external audio (TV or Receiver)  it'll probably work OK, although the UI is absolutely horrible and the system is buggy.  But, for my use, it just didn't cut it.I wanted to hook this up with the Alexa Home Theater mode with 2 x Echo Studio and an Echo Sub, connecting other devices (including Apple TV, which has a far superior interface and better integration with the Apple ecosystem) to my LG OLED using ARC to return audio.  The point was to roll-in Alexa Music into better sound for the TV.  But, it just doesn't work that well.  Here are some of the problems I ran into:1) When I use the Echos to play music, the Fire TV Cube will lose audio on TV content.  When it comes back seems random.  I get a lot better results if I go to the Fire TV Cube and try to play some content there first, but even that doesn't always work.  I wound up turning off audio input on this system to try to manage this better, but it only helped marginally.2) Automation is terrible through voice.  It just stopped working.  At first it seemed to work fine, so I got another one for the main home theater system in another room.  When I told this one to turn on the TV, nothing appeared to happen...until I discovered that this system was turning on the OTHER TV connected to the other Fire TV Cube.3) ARC from the TV mysteriously stopped working.4) Setup is inconsistent.  I probably tried going through the set up 2 dozen time to try to fix some of this.  Sometimes it recognizes the other devices.  Sometimes it doesn't.  Sometimes it'll allow you to configure the inputs on the TV.  Sometimes it doesn't.5) Always trying to upsell you.  You think you used the generic screen saver, which is important to prevent burn-in on plasma and OLED TVs and it'll often revert to try to get you to try new content.6) A lot of stupid annoying random bugs.After sinking a bunch of dough (AND TIME) into this, I'm throwing in the towel.  Bought a Yamaha receiver and speakers and just sticking with that.  I wish I hadn't spent so much time on this and was in the timeframe to return the two Echo Studios, Echo Sub, and Fire TV Cube.  One of the most annoying devices I ever had the displeasure to wrangle with.Unless you're seriously anti-Apple for some reason.  Save yourself the trouble.  Get an Apple TV, a receiver (I like Yamaha), and some speakers.  True, the ATV doesn't have the pseudo universal remote capability, but it just doesn't work that well with the Fire TV in any case, so you'll save yourself some grief if you get something that just works, even if it doesn't do everything you want.",https://www.amazon.com/All-new-fire-tv-cube-4k-streaming-device/product-reviews/B09BZZ3MM7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1
Unknown,R24V22A84626N0,Critical,"Amazon Fire TV Cube, Hands-free streaming device with Alexa, Wi-Fi 6E, 4K Ultra HD",4.5,1.0,"11,981","After several months of use, I thought this review needed an update. If it was possible to change my 1 star rating to zero stars, I would definitely do it. I keep hoping for software upgrades that would address some of the issues, but none have been forthcoming. I can't even get the upgrade that I know is currently out as the Cube says it is up to date. It isn't.Audio issues have gotten worse over time. When Surround is set to ""Best Available"", it is always Dolby MAT and only recognizes Atmos for Amazon content. Sound output on Dolby MAT is so low it is essentially unusable. The hype on the screen says it will provide the best format up to Dolby Mat, but that is just a lie. It provides Dolby MAT period. Similarly when set to Dolby Digital Plus it is always Dolby Digital Plus, and there is considerable delay before it recognizes Atmos, and often it doesn't recognize it at all unless I reboot the Cube. The issue with the HBO MAX app appears to have been resolved as I no longer have to restart the Cube every time I want sound on that app from the Cube. This really is a terrible product if audio matters to you at all. And audio does matter to me.And I still don't understand why Amazon won't at least give me the latest system software for the Cube. I know there are serious security issues with the version I am running (7.6.1.3) and I know 7.6.2.5 is out, but the Cube says it is up to date. Totally unacceptable service from Amazon.On top of that, the Alexa volume from the Cube's internal speaker is so low now that it is undetectable  if my ear is more than a foot away from the device, though it's medium OK through the TV. Volume on the Cube is set to maximum. The microphone isn't sensitive enough to pick up a shout from more than 6 feet away, and a shout is required at any distance from the unit.External USB storage devices are pretty much limited to thumb drives. Have tried several hard drives (formatted correctly) and none are recognized by the Cube, and it takes a significant amount of time for it to recognize a thumb drive, but it eventually does.Though it would be a huge hassle to untangle all of my Amazon stuff, I'm seriously considering switching to Apple, because this product is just terrible and Amazon doesn't seem interested in fixing it. Pretty much all of the issues are audio related. Video is pretty much OK.Previous revue:Well, I've only had it two days and lots of issues. Not ready for prime time, but when it works, it's excellent. First, it was supposed to come linked to my Amazon account. Nope that didn't happen. Shuts down at random for no reason. Takes it quite a while to recognize a change in audio format leaving me with several seconds of moving lips with no sound at all. Alexa's volume is too low even at max when running through the built in speaker. Fine running through the TV. Audio outputs are also way low. Soundbar goes up to 100, but the cube needs 20 points more than the Firestick 4K it replaces. Still usable, but strange. Hard to say at this point if it's a hardware or software issue. HBO Max app is especially problematic as far as audio is concerned. Many settings are inadequately explained. Setup asked if I wanted to import from a previous version. I've had 4 Firestick Versions before this, but my only option was to import from my very first Firestick rather than my 4K. Only had it 2 days, and maybe software updates will fix it. I'll give it a couple more days to see if it settles down, but right now it's pretty wonky. This stuff should have been worked out before they shipped.RevisedReduced the star rating to 1 because the problems are inexcusable.After 3 days of troubleshooting, I think I may have resolved the issues. The issue of the cube randomly shutting down seems to have been resolved by unplugging the cube and plugging it back in.Other issues all involved my setting the audio to ""Best Available"". Changing to Dolby Digital Plus appears to have resolved the issues.In my case, the ""Best Available"" was Dolby MAT/Dolby Atmos Mat. The problems were several and intermittent.1) Sometimes when adjusting the volume using the cube's remote cause the audio to go away altogether. Made no sense and was very difficult to receiver as it wasn't simply a matter of it muting the sound system, the cube wasn't actually putting out sound to the system at all. Randoom buttoon pushing was the only resolution.2) With the audio set t ""Best Available"" the cube frequently did not recoognize when a Dolby Atmos prgram had started. This was intermittent. Sometimes it switched from Dolby MAT, to Dolby Atmos MAT and sometimes it didn't. A woork around was to start the program go to Settings, chose Display & Sounds Settings, Go down to the Audio & Video Diagnostics and click ""Play Dolby Atmos and HDR Content."" Then hit the back button repeatedly until you get back to the program and hit play. I am not making this up.3) Once I got Dolby Atmos MAT enabled, it didn't go away when playing non-Atmos content. It did seem to play 5.1 OK while Atmos was enabled, but eventually it would bounce back to Dolby MAT, but this was also often problematic. When switching back, it went smooothly some of the time. Other times, it killed the audio altogether leaving me with the same issues as above. The other transition was even worse. The picture began flashing with the audio going on and off. The oonly work around I could find was really weird. I opened HULU and played any episode of Letterkenny. No other program oon any service including HULU worked reliably. I cannot explain this, but it is what happened.3) the low volume issue was completely resolved with the switch to Dolby Digital+ as opposed to Best Available.Solution was indeed the change in Audio Settings from ""Best Available"" to ""Dolby Digital+"". With this setting so far, Dolby Atmos was recognized on all three of the services to which I subscribe that support it, and it dropped back to 5.1 or whatever other format was appropriate to the content. As I just foound this solution this morning I can't claim that all issues are permanently resolved, but at least the seem to be for the time being. The Alexa thing is still useless when it uses it's own speaker, but fine when it uses the sound system.But it appears I wasted 3 days of challenging troubleshoooting t fid a solution and I ain't happy. Amazon doesn't document much of anything, and the on screen info is limited and often confusing. It's inexcusable that  Amazon would release a product that requires that much time and effort on the part of a user to unravel. Should have been caught and fixed in testing before it was released on unsuspecting consumers. I am seriously angry at having to do their job for them without the nice compensation they pay their engineers for.",https://www.amazon.com/All-new-fire-tv-cube-4k-streaming-device/product-reviews/B09BZZ3MM7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1
Unknown,R1HSXTY7B1NQZ3,Critical,"Amazon Fire TV Cube, Hands-free streaming device with Alexa, Wi-Fi 6E, 4K Ultra HD",4.5,3.0,"11,981","Be sure to watch my video review in the review section above!Amazon released their third generation Fire TV Cube the other day. Whenever Amazon announces a refresh of their high end TV streamer enthusiasts get excited, and every time they’re left disappointed. This time is no exception but it does remain a great choice for general consumers who are invested in the Amazon Alexa eco system.That’s not to say the new Cube is a bad product. It in fact combines two Amazon products – an Amazon Echo voice assistant and a Fire TV – into a single product. The Cube has a powerful speaker built in that works when the television is off for voice commands. Like other Alexa devices it can control any compatible smart home device.The Cube can also be instructed to turn on specific devices hooked up to the television and select the proper inputs for those devices. So for example you could ask Alexa for the Xbox and it will properly power everything on and switch the television and/or audio receiver to the right input without picking up a remote control. While some of the Fire TV Sticks can accomplish the same tasks it does require picking up a voice remote to do it.The Cube does have an HDMI input that’s designed to be used as a cable box passthrough. This is for simplicity for those challenged by having multiple devices connected to their television, allowing for the Cube and the cable box to work through a single input on the television.It’ll also upconvert other sources plugged into that HDMI port to a 4k output resolution but my preference is to set things at their native resolutions and have my television’s built in scaler handle the job. Note that the Cube's HDMI input is not ideal for upscaling game consoles as the video processing does introduce some latency.Amazon added Wifi 6E support to the Cube which performs well but not all that much better than what we experienced recently on the Fire TV Stick 4k Max. You will of course need a WiFi 6E access point or router to take full advantage of the enhanced networking performance. But it is of course backwards compatible with older WiFi standards.Beyond that the Cube largely does what other TV boxes and sticks do: stream video from streaming services. It supports 4k HDR modes including HDR10, 10+, HLG and Dolby Vision. It also supports Dolby Atmos audio from supported providers. You’ll find most if not all of the popular streaming apps available on the cube. At least for now.So the bottom line for most consumers is that if you’re heavily invested in the Amazon smarthome ecosystem the Cube will give you both Echo and Fire TV functionality in a single box with app performance that justifies its price point.But why are enthusiasts disappointed? It’s because it doesn’t have quite enough built in.The first involves its networking. Enthusiasts like to plug their devices directly into Ethernet for the best performance. The Cube has an ethernet port but it maxes out at 100 megabits per second. Most boxes that are in the Cube’s price range like the Apple TV and Nvidia Shield have gigabit ethernet. While most streaming services max out at around 40 megabits per second even with 4k broadcasts, many enthusiasts stream higher bit rate video with their home servers that require more than 100 megabits per second of bandwidth. Amazon also went with a slow USB 2.0 port that powers itself off when the box is switched off vs. the faster USB 3 ports we see on most boxes.Audio support is also a bit flaky on this. The box converts most audio to PCM and does not pass it through directly. This means that movies stored on a personal server that play lossless Atmos or DTS audio will likely have the audio quality degraded by the player and not all surround channels will be activated.Unlike some Android boxes out there the Cube does have an option for “frame rate switching” where it will switch the frame rate of the television to match the content. Most movies and many streaming shows are shot at 24 frames per second and televisions have special modes to play back that content properly. While it’s nice that it has the option most of the apps I ran on the Cube didn’t support the feature and played back 24p content at 60p. The Cube did do proper framerate switching in Plex, however.The Cube does not support 64 bit applications just 32 bit ones. While this doesn’t matter much for streaming apps it is a bigger deal for gamers looking to emulate game consoles on the box. Some of the more modern emulators are only available as a 64 bit download. And when Android apps are “sideloaded” on to the Cube they often appear with blank icons. There’s a fairly lengthy process involved with getting those icons to appear properly.So in many areas the Cube falls short of being an ideal experience. Although the same can be said for most competing boxes too. Which is why we all keep multiples attached depending on the task at hand. We all just want the box that does everything.But for now my top pick for enthusiasts remains the Nvidia Shield. While it has its own shortfalls what’s amazing is how much Nvidia got right with that box seven years ago. To this day it remains the most graphically powerful Android box on the market.",https://www.amazon.com/All-new-fire-tv-cube-4k-streaming-device/product-reviews/B09BZZ3MM7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1
Unknown,R1NT79OZYJ4AJ9,Critical,"Amazon Fire TV Cube, Hands-free streaming device with Alexa, Wi-Fi 6E, 4K Ultra HD",4.5,2.0,"11,981","Cliff notes version of my review is “For me, this Fire TV Cube did not work too well controlling my Cable box”. Of course, your results may vary… Details below:I recently purchased the Amazon Fire TV Cube. I have wanted to try this with my old TV since the New Fire TV Cube came out, and the sale this weekend pushed me over the edge. Unfortunately for me, it did not meet my expectations for what I wanted to use it for. I have a Panasonic Plasma TV that I won’t give up just yet since it still has a very nice picture, but the problem with it is it has only 1 HDMI input. I have tried several HDMI switches to add more devices, but I have not found one that switches properly. I was hoping I could use the Fire TV Cube with my cable box so I could primarily watch cable, and still have access to Amazon’s streaming services. In the end, it did not work out so well.To start, I used 2 new High Speed HDMI cables to run from my Spectrum cable box to the Fire TV Cube input and I then connected the Fire TV Cube output to my Panasonic Plasma TV. I used an IR Extender placed in front of my TV and cable box. If you don’t have one of these, you will need some Long HDMI cables, since the TV and cable box need a clear view of the front of your Fire TV Cube. I then started the programming process to get the Fire TV Cube to control my TV. It took 3 runs through the setup before it would operate the power and sound on my TV. I then started the setup for my Spectrum cable box. That seemed easy, until I tried to watch cable. The Fire TV Cube would turn on the TV, and the cable box was on, but there was no picture or sound. I discovered the Fire TV Cube was switching the inputs on my TV to something other than HDMI, so I had to go through the TV setup a couple more times until it stopped switching the TV’s inputs. I didn’t change anything, it just started to stay on the HDMI input. There was still no picture though. The picture and sound on the Amazon home page was great, just nothing on the cable. After some reboots and moving cables around, the cable came on. That was enough setup for one day, after having spent about 5 hours trying to figure this out. I finally had cable working with my Fire TV Cube. I came back to the TV after dinner to watch cable, hit the power button on the remote, and nothing! No power on the TV, I hit the button several times, and still nothing. Then it came on with no prompt or button pushing. Quite the turn on delay here! I was able to switch to cable, but no other functions on the remote would control the cable box. Enough! I unplugged the Fire TV Cube and hooked my cable box up directly to watch some shows.The next day is here, and I am ready to conquer this adventure! I hooked up the Fire TV Cube again to see how Alexa would work. This time it came on right away and I was able to turn on my cable box with the programmed shortcut key. Oh Boy! It works! My enthusiasm was short lived, as I then asked Alexa to tune to the weather channel. Alexa switched back to the Amazon home page and tried to install the Weather Channel app. No, I wanted to watch the weather channel on cable… I switched back to cable and asked Alexa to go to the HGTV channel. Alexa replied something like” You don’t have an input labeled HGTV”. I then tried to get her to go to a channel by number, and Alexa said “I’m sorry, I don’t understand”, OK, I will try this. I said go to the Science channel. I watched the blue light bar on the Fire TV Cube scan back and forth, and 20 seconds later Alexa switched to the Science Channel. I tried several channels, and yes I timed it. 20 Seconds to switch channels by voice! A bit slow, but finally something worked. I also noticed it takes about a second per push to navigate through the cable box channel guide. I also had an issue with the channel guide advancing to the second menu, like I had pushed the button twice. I tried adjusting the IR timing in the Fire TV Cube settings section, but this did not seem to help. Another issue came up also, where when I said Alex to the remote to issue a channel change command, my TV would mute. I could see the Mute label come up on my TV screen, but hitting the mute button on the remote did not unmute. I had to use the volume up or down button to hear the sound again.I had more issues with this device trying to get it to operate my cable box correctly, but I have said too much already. To sum it up, If you want a good Fire TV streaming box, this is a good option. It is quick when you are using the apps and gives you a nice looking Alexa device in your TV viewing area. For me, wanting this as a cable controller first and streaming device second, this one did not work out. The Fire TV Cube and Alexa Voice Remote Pro have been returned to Amazon.",https://www.amazon.com/All-new-fire-tv-cube-4k-streaming-device/product-reviews/B09BZZ3MM7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1

Pre-order ad free to watch without ads.""Guess the $9,000 I spent with Amazon in 2023 alone was just not enough.  If I want fewer ads, pay more.  My request for fewer ads was monitized.  Guess enough is not enough...---------------------------------------------------I’m a staunch supporter of Amazon and will continue to be as I have found the company to be a reasonable and reliable partner in my commerce related endeavors.  My two Amazon Fire TV Cubes work great, however, they are going to the back of a closet shelf until someone at Amazon, whether that be AI or human, corrects the following problems;Because I choose to not watch advertising, I’ve kicked broadcast television to the ditch as it has become a 50/50 mix of poor content versus an equal amount of inane advertisements, many of which are simply blatant false claims.  Just can’t bear to waste so much time, and so no broadcast tv for me or mine.Yes, I choose to limit myself and family’s exposure to commercials/advertising - that is why I pay for my entertainment services.  Amazon however will not let me remove the Freevee channel (advertisement driven) and several other apps from their tv box.The top leader portion of the intro screen is often a listing of items that have to be purchased, as well as in the listings below the top leader, having channels I am not subscribed to and movies also requiring purchases beyond my monthly subscription fees.There needs to be a setting whereby unsubscribed channels and pay movies (and advertisement driven offerings), are automatically removed.  Takes too long to filter through all these items to find something to watch that has no cost attached.And I absolutely refuse to pay to watch advertising.  Yet when I use my Amazon Fire Tv Box, I am inundated by a slew of personalized directives meant to maximize my purchase of channels and movies – these directives apparently created just for me by AI driven algorithms.  These are nothing but indirect, even covert advertisements.I know I cannot win against such an adversary.  Heaven forbid I select favorites, rate movies, or select for wish lists, as I will undoubtably find them offered up on a channel I am not subscribed to or a movie listing that requires payment.Neither do I wish to see previews of other movies before a movie I have selected to watch begins.  When my family sits down to watch tv I want to be completely in control of what is shown on the screen.  Amazon cannot select the previews I let my family watch.  As a result of Amazon doing just that, my family has been exposed to vile blood and guts movie scenes and more.I have no intention of paying more than my budgeted monthly cost for the three channel maximum I choose to subscribe to – and those channels best not base their success on additional earning from me over that monthly base cost.  Amazon is wasting both of our time with constant strategies to increase earnings.This is why one channel in particularly is such a success – its services are just what it states they are, with no added attempts at additional ‘added value’ earnings, and allows watching of offerings in binge mode as opposed to doling out episodes one week at a time, which just another inconvenient strategy tied to earnings.So I purchased  and set up in my home two Amazon Fire  TV set boxes and several Alexa devices and make purchases consistently of your Amazon Marketplace web site. I paid for the hardware, I pay to use the hardware through my Prime fee -  how much  additional advertisement to you think I should allow into my home?  Is there an advertising overflow relief valve?  When will enough be enough.  Is there a brake pedal on your AI?  When will Amazon and Amazon AI understand that at times LESS truly IS MORE….I'll check back in 6 months and see if anything has changed.  I know Amazon has been responsive in the past.  For now, I will go back to an older tv box of another brand and if that’s not satisfactory....  will just turn the darn tv off.------------------------------UPDATE - Amazon did in fact contact me about this review stating the points made have been passed up the ladder for consideration.The support person did point out that on the Amazon Video apps initial screen there is a discrete listing called 'Amazon Originals and Exclusives' where all listings are viewable at no additional cost, if you are an Amazon Prime member.  That was helpful as it is not obvious.I value the fact that Amazon even choose to list such a critical review.  I continue to be impressed that such a large company as Amazon can still be responsive to individual customer needs.",https://www.amazon.com/All-new-fire-tv-cube-4k-streaming-device/product-reviews/B09BZZ3MM7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1
Unknown,R13T62N84J1LCA,Critical,"Amazon Fire TV Cube, Hands-free streaming device with Alexa, Wi-Fi 6E, 4K Ultra HD",4.5,2.0,"11,981","I purchased 2 of these one for my living room and on for my master bedroom.  I will be returning the MB one and keeping the LR one.For years I've been using the Harmony Hub with Alexa to turn on and off my Samsung TV, Sony soundbar, and DirecTV HS17 -100 Genie2.  But it stopped working. Then the Cube 3 was released and the reviews were impressive.  The one feature that was different from all the other devices out there was the HDMI pass-thru.  Being able to control all my devices and streaming through one product was what I was looking for.  I was so very wrong.Setup was pretty easy, it discovered my TV but had some issues with my sound bar, but eventually figured it out after cycling through about 10 different frequencies.  The Cube detected my DTV box, but couldn't talk to or control it, even after doing so during the setup process.  Yes, I have gone through and connected the Cube to Alexa and enabled all the skills and created routines.  But no matter what, the Cube cannot switch the input to it's own internal HDMI input that has DTV.  It also cannot turn it on, off or change the channel.The picture through the HDMI IN on the Cube looked terrible.  It was washed out and not crisp and clear.  I tried all the Cube display settings, but couldn't get a decent picture.  I even tried multiple HDMI cables but no matter what, I could not get a decent picture from the Cube HDMI IN.  I used to go through a Sony AV receiver and the picture was just as good as connecting directly to my TV.  So, this should not be happening.  I tried it on my TV upstairs with the same results.  The HDMI IN on my two Cubes does not work.I removed DTV from the Cube HDMI IN and plugged it directly into my TV and went through the Cube setup again.  I went through the Add Devices setup and it found the DTV box on my TV connected to my TV HDMI input, it could switch input on the TV and change the channel on the DTV box through the setup  process.  But once setup is complete, Alexa can only turn on DTV and switch the TV input.  it cannot change the channel or do anything else.Another issue is that no matter what the Cube starts on it's home page.  Even when you select the option to have the TV decide what Input to select when it powers on or to start an App.  The TV starts on the input 1, then switches to input 2 that the Cube is on.  The Cube does not open the App I've selected it to default to in the settings, all you will get is the Home page.  I had to setup a routine that turns everything on then switches the input back to input 1 so I can watch DTV.I got the second Cube to put in my MB as an alternative to getting a new TV.  I have an older Sony TV that  is very slow when it comes to streaming and doesn't have Bluetooth.  I have an external BT transmitter connected that works about 50% of the time.  Again one device to control everything and take over streaming and add BT seemed like exactly what I was looking for.  Nope, wrong again.The HDMI cables needed a bit of force to be inserted.  Pulling them out was even worse, so no matter what this Cube was going back.  But I figured I'd test it anyway.  The HDMI IN picture looked terrible, as it did on my other TV.  So, I could not pass DTV through the Cube, which means I cannot use the BT on the cube.  I tested BT on the Cube just to try it and it worked great.  Pairing was easy and there is no lag.  But then I turned off my BT headset and the Cube shouted, ""Bluetooth has been disconnected!""  Imagine this, you're laying in bed, watching TV while your partner sleeps, you decide it's time to go to bed and turn off your TV and take off your BT headset.  Only to have the Cube, even when it's turned off shout, ""Bluetooth has been disconnected!"" I spent hours, turning off all notifications and searching through every forum I could find to stop this from happening.  Only to find that this has been and Amazon Echo/Alexa issue for YEARS.In conclusion:- The Cube is very fast- HDMI IN has terrible picture quality- If you have DirecTV expect only the most basic of control options.- Cube will only start up to it's own Menu no matter what setting you select you will only get the Home screen- Bluetooth disconnection is a deal breaker.1 has been returned, haven't decided if I'm keeping the second one yet.  Probably return the second one as well, since I got it for the HDMI In and it's unusable.",https://www.amazon.com/All-new-fire-tv-cube-4k-streaming-device/product-reviews/B09BZZ3MM7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1
Unknown,R1OIKEERVC3NNP,Critical,"Amazon Fire TV Cube, Hands-free streaming device with Alexa, Wi-Fi 6E, 4K Ultra HD",4.5,3.0,"11,981","On the hardware, comparing the Gen 1 and this Gen 3, there is a noticeable improvement. Navigating around is smoother and interfaces feel like they load quicker. Having one remote for almost everything is also great; I no longer need multiple remotes to manage my setup. On the hardware side, here are my issues:1. Sadly, they chose to continue with the 2GB of RAM which puts this device to shame. The Gen 3 Cube could have been so much more and with RAM being dirt cheap, it wouldn't have costed them anything. Everyone knows that they almost always discount their devices so why not add $5 and increase the RAM? Whoever decided 2GB was sufficient, made a really really poor choice which lacked customer obsession; they clearly didn't work from customer needs or haven't been on the internet to hear customers.2. When the Pro remote is an option, why not sell the Cube with the Pro remote as an option? Why am I forced to have 2 remotes when I prefer to pay extra and have the Pro remote?On the operating system side, they have almost done the best they can. Here are my top issues with the current state:1. After having set the equipment up, the default volume control is via the remote which requires line of sight. Being the 21st century, no one points the remote at the TV anymore but this Gen 3 Cube is hoping to make that trendy again!? It is a simple change in the Advanced Settings to switch the volume control to happen by the Cube.2. You can no longer setup a Cable box like before. WHAAaaAT!? You have to connect the cable's HDMI to the input of the Cube or else you have no way of switching to it. There is an Antenna that can be configured but it doesn't recognize the cable box and simply switches the TV to its antenna input.3. When you hook the cable box directly to the Cube and switch to it, hitting the TV Guide button on the remote not only triggers the guide on the cable box, but it also triggers the guide on the Live TV feature of the Cube. So if you were watching a program on the Cable and hit the TV Guide button, you would see the Live TV Guide and would have to hit the back button twice to see the TV Guide on your cable box.4. Either the mics are bad or the Alexa software is buggy. Even though I have the Favor This Device setting on, talking to Alexa on the Cube while sitting right in front of her, the ancient Echo Show in the Kitchen responds. The outgoing Gen 1 Cube sat exactly in the same location and had no such problem.5. The Parental Controls have always been annoying; looking at the notifications requires unlocking but Alexa would happily read them to you. There are a few other places the unlocking is unnecessarily applied; at least make it configurable for people to do as they please. I would literally take 5 minutes to code this, 2 hours to write tests, and 2 hours to localize the strings.6. While some 3rd party apps have been developed properly to exit on hitting back twice from the app's main screen, there are many that don't honor this like Netflix. The operating system should have a feature to kill the foreground app on the long press of the back button. With the limited amount of RAM, having a bunch of apps still in the background, even for a minute is too much as it slows down the device.While, as a buyer, you clearly have no choice in the selecting the generation of Cube to buy on Amazon , as you get the latest one only, it is certainly less frustrating than using the Gen 1 and its primitive remote.",https://www.amazon.com/All-new-fire-tv-cube-4k-streaming-device/product-reviews/B09BZZ3MM7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1
Unknown,R3IQ92I8Y9NOQB,Critical,"Amazon Fire TV Cube, Hands-free streaming device with Alexa, Wi-Fi 6E, 4K Ultra HD",4.5,1.0,"11,981","Since I had Alexa in my house I decided to take the plunge and switch from Roku to Fire TV.  I bought this for my living room to use with my Samsung TV to replace the Roku Ultra.It's absolutely atrocious, in all aspects.First of all, the Fire TV platform is disgusting.  Everything is an ad, everywhere.  You pause your program?  Ad.  You let it go idle for more that 60 seconds?  Ad.  Your home screen?  Nothing but ads.  Your tiles for your apps are so tiny compared to all the trash on the home screen it's laughable.Second, this thing is ridiculously incompatible with most other devices and device setups.  Basically, if you're not just hooking it up to a TV and NOTHING ELSE, then you can expect to have problems.  Have a soundbar connected via ARC?  Well expect it to mute sound randomly when using other HDMI inputs, and it sometimes won't fix itself until you restart the Fire Cube.  Trying to use a game console on one of your other HDMI inputs?  Expect the Fire Cube to aggressively switch back to itself in the middle of your games.  Trying to adjust settings on your TV?  Nope, you get 3 seconds in and Fire Cube says back to Fire TV.  Oh, but wait you can turn off CEC on your TV and it fixes some of these!  Oh wait, then your ARC soundbar doesn't work anymore.  So maybe turn off CEC on the Cube?  Now enjoy nothing switching automatically!Third, the Alexa integration to Fire TV is tolerable on a good day.  It was okay in the beginning, but now if I ask it to launch X channel on X app, it never gets it right anymore.  Which completely defeats the purpose of me switching to this platform.Fourth, Amazon's ridiculous wars with other service providers due to their unrelenting greed.  I had a Spectrum cable package that would allow me to use the Spectrum app.  This was fine on Roku, but low and behold, Fire TV doesn't have the Spectrum app.  Why?  Because Amazon doesn't want Spectrum on their platform as they are a competitor and they want to be a monopoly.  Disgusting.  And absolutely unacceptable.  Okay well fine, I guess I can just use the Spectrum app on my Smart TV.  Oh, wait the Fire TV won't LET me use anything on my Smart TV without switching back 3 seconds later.  Fixes?  See above.Fifth, and I know it's petty.  But that STUPID REMOTE.  DESIGN A REMOTE THAT I CAN TELL IF IT'S UPSIDE DOWN WITHOUT LOOKING AT IT!  It's so annoying, like a USB-A cable, it's always upside down every time I pick it up and I'm hitting channel up instead of volume down.  And please make the battery cover stay on.  I have two of these and the battery cover goes flying off every chance it gets.This product is a joke.  It's a monument to how little Amazon cares about their Alexa/Fire TV users.  Charging a premium price for something that's unusable half the time.  They don't care about your user experience, they only care about how many ads they can stuff down your throat.  They don't care about what their users want.  They don't care about making a product that's compatible with anything other than their own products.Long story short here: STICK WITH ROKUUPDATE 1:  Going to continue posting how bad things are with this awful device.  Newest issue, before I had problems with sound when using other devices, now the stupid thing will just lose sound completely when I'm just using Fire TV normally.  I have to restart this thing at least 3-4 times a day to fix this issue.  Absolutely irritating.UPDATE 2:  Got a call from Amazon about my review of my two Fire TV products.  Customer support was nice enough but they seem to be clueless just how bad their product is compared to competitors.  They seem to think having to factory reset your Fire TV every month to keep it from freezing is acceptable.  They also tried to feed me some garbage about all the CEC issues I was experiencing.  Saying I could safely turn off the CEC and everything would work because the Cube has an “IR blaster” on all sides so it doesn’t need CEC.  I don’t know if it’s true but I can tell you it doesn’t work.  I moved the cube everywhere around my entertainment center and nothing worked anymore with CEC off.  And they seemed to miss the general point of my argument being that this shouldn’t be so difficult to get working properly because for some reason their competitors don’t have ANY of these issues.I’ve finally had enough and will be dumping my Alexa devices for Google, after less than a year.  Whatever updates they’ve been feeding Alexa has made it practically unusable and it was never great to begin with.  She can’t turn on my lights anymore, can’t work my TV, can’t shut off my alarms, can barely even respond correctly half the time.  The only thing she does really well anymore is bombard me with annoying notifications I can’t turn off.I really tried the smart home setup with Alexa.  But unless Amazon shows they actually give a shit about customer experience I cannot recommend any of their Alexa products.",https://www.amazon.com/All-new-fire-tv-cube-4k-streaming-device/product-reviews/B09BZZ3MM7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1
Unknown,R2979BG0V8Y1MW,Critical,"Amazon Fire TV Cube, Hands-free streaming device with Alexa, Wi-Fi 6E, 4K Ultra HD",4.5,3.0,"11,981","The new features of the gen 3 Fire TV Cube are welcome. They have finally added an Ethernet port to the Cube and the new HDMI input reduces input switching previously necessary.You would think that after releasing the third generation of the Fire TV Cube that Amazon would finally correct obvious problems in the previous releases. Sadly, that does not appear to be the case. Not only are a lot of the old bugs still there, they have introduced new ones. For example, when you connect it to a home theater and set the sound to “best available” the HDMI format sent to your surround sound system is actually in PCM mode except in the case where the input was in Dolby Atmos. For some reason, it is happy to pass Dolby Atmos but converts everything else to PCM. This did not happen with the gen 2 Fire TV Cube.I bought this for use with a new TV to retain the ability to play Amazon Recast TV recordings. You still get the stupid message when you play many DVR recordings that the recording is bad because of low signal strength even though the recordings are always pretty much perfect. I wish there was a way to turn off that message.If when watching a Recast TV recording and you press the menu button and check the TV listings, when you return to your recording the red bar that informs you where you are in the recording stops working. To get it back, you need to stop and then restart the playback. With the new Gen 3 Cube, this problem seems to happen much more often, sometimes when you first start a playback for no apparent reason.If you set the Recast DVR to record all professional football games, because networks allot time slots from 3 to 3½ hours for a game, you probably want to record for an extra 30 minutes to account for overtime games. There is no way adjust the extra time differently for various networks which is not usually a problem. But if you decide to start watching an early game after the next game of the day has started on the same network, but before the allotted overtime recording has completed, you are out of luck. The early game will not appear in the list of recordings to play until the extra 30 minutes is over. This also happens if you started watching the early game and accidentally exited the recording after the late game has started. You cannot restart viewing the first game until the overtime recording has finished.I don’t know if Amazon fixed the stupid error, you occasionally get where you can play any Recast TV recording but cannot delete them or create any new recordings. You get a message that your Recast DVR and Fire TV Cube are on different networks. This is obviously false because they are both connected to the same Ethernet switch and to play a recording, the Ethernet communication must be working.When you check for updates on any Amazon Fire TV Cube, you quite often see one or more updates to install. It’s a mystery to why after literally dozens of updates, that these problems are never corrected. Virtually all of the Recast TV problems that I listed have been there for over five years starting with the Gen 1 Fire TV Cube. They never get fixed. I hope that doesn’t happen with the sound settings for the Gen 3 Fire TV Cube but based on past experience this may not be the case.",https://www.amazon.com/All-new-fire-tv-cube-4k-streaming-device/product-reviews/B09BZZ3MM7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1
Unknown,R2CRZMNJTAPJBW,Critical,"Amazon Fire TV Cube, Hands-free streaming device with Alexa, Wi-Fi 6E, 4K Ultra HD",4.5,3.0,"11,981","I picked up a 3rd Gen Cube in the hopes that I could get all the benefits of my Shield plus AV1 codec support. Things have not worked out that way.Audio========Since I have an AVR, audio is a big factor for me and so when I saw that the 3rd Gen added bitstreaming support for surround sound formats, I was hopeful. However, the reality is quite a bit different.As things stand currently, you're forced to choose between having Atmos support OR bitstreaming any other Dolby formats. This is because Amazon currently has a broken DolbyMAT implementation. There is a topic on this on Amazon's support forums that goes back almost a full calendar year about this issue, with multiple Amazon reps commenting, but no resolution.https://www.amazonforum.com/s/question/0D56Q0000Ajjn6gSQA/fire-cube-3-gen-eac3-ac3-broken-under-best-available-audio-option-settingVideo=======I have no complaints about the video quality. Low bitrate/resolution videos still look bad, high bitrate/resolution videos look good.Interface & Ads==============This was the final nail in the coffin for this device. I could deal with the home screen that's nothing but ads except for like a 2 inch wide strip in the middle of the screen where about 1/2 of that is where I can pin a couple frequently used apps. I rarely saw the home screen for more than a few seconds, so I could deal with that. I wasn't happy that Amazon actively prevents you from using any other launchers or apps like Launcher Manager to remap the home button, but again, I could live with that because I know Amazon sells the hardware at a pretty significant loss and makes up the difference by selling ads. I looked into jailbreaking the device, but it seemed more trouble than it was worth.However, after the latest update that came out sometime in the last couple of days, which introduced full screen ads (I've seen some say it can include full screen video and audio if you don't turn off some of the built-in spyware) when you start the device... that was a bridge too far. Some might say it's only one extra click on the remote, but I already had to click to the right about three times just to get to where my apps were, which is already too many.If there were something like the Kindle e-readers where you could pay a small fee and have the ads removed from the device, and use whatever launcher you wanted, I'd probably be all over that.Remote=========I don't exactly hate this remote, not like the Siri remote for the first gen AppleTV 4K, but I also do not like it. The buttons are just so tiny it's hard to be able to find the right one from feel. Took me a bit to learn that I had to hold down the talk button for the remote's microphone to remain active, something that does not appear to be documented anywhere.Final Thoughts=============If you have an AVR, this isn't a Shield killer. If Amazon fixes their DolbyMAT implementation and reverts the full screen ad change, maybe, but right now, just no.If you don't have a surround sound speaker setup, then you still have the full screen ads to contend with, along with all the other ads, but it is otherwise a solid bit of hardware.I am planning to sell my Cube and will likely never even consider any FireTV devices again.",https://www.amazon.com/All-new-fire-tv-cube-4k-streaming-device/product-reviews/B09BZZ3MM7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1

To say that I am invested in the Fire TV Echo System is an understatement.  I can state that the Fire TV Cube 3rd Gen is by far the best of the Fire TV's sold by Amazon.  I replaced one of my 2nd Gen Fire TV Cubes and the set up was super easy with integration to my Wifi and downloading of already owned apps a breeze. (setting up the passwords for all the apps continues to be a pain and took a long time to do).  The aesthetics of this Fire TV is the best of the lot, it looks really premium.  The interface is the same as the others however, the speed of navigation is fantastic.  It is really fast making it a real joy to use.  The Wifi 6E is supported however I can't tell the difference in the speed, but I can tell you that application buffering is really almost non existent.  I have a T-Mobile 5G Gateway that averages 306 Mbs and supports wifi 6E, so perhaps that does make a difference.  I have this cube attached to an LG 4K 65 inch TV and use a Yamaha 800 sound bar (attached via an optical cable). My Fire TV also controls a Sony DVD player, and Sony Playstation.  I can switch between all HDMI inputs with no problem by voice.  I do think that the 3rd gen cube produces a better sound quality through my Yamaha sound bar since it does support a wider range of output.  Alexa works flawlessly as well, so no complaints. . So my net net is 1) Really fast performance, 2) better sound quality, 3) looks like a premium streaming device with the cloth enclosure, 4) very nice upgraded remote, 5) Alexa works great at controlling my TV and Sound Bar, 6) Integrated IN and OUT HDMI connectivity ports (which I don't use).  My only negative is that one of the hot key's on the remote is  Direct TV, which I would never use and would love to be able to change it. Also for the price, Amazon should have included the premium remote (backlit) with this Fire TV.I would recommend this Fire TV Cube 3rd Gen for your main viewing area over all other Fire TVs. I would buy this on sale vs. the list price.  I was able to purchase this Cube for $119 plus my trade in.  In my book speed is king and this Fire TV will not disappoint you.  I am confident that I will be using this Fire TV for the next 5 years minimum.",https://www.amazon.com/All-new-fire-tv-cube-4k-streaming-device/product-reviews/B09BZZ3MM7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1

Too often my TV was freezing or forcing reboots and I just had a feeling it had to do with the processor being a little old and not being able to keep up with running all my subscriptions and apps. It's a 65 inch, so replacing it entirely would be out of my budget at this time.The fire cube gave my TV a second life!Now if you've ever owned an alexa device, you probably know the first time powering on and setting up your device takes ages. Well that was especially true in my experience with the fire cube. PLEASE NOTE! it does require an ARC HDMI!! Sometimes you have to turn on ARC in your TV settings, and it's usually a dedicated HDMI port. This was my first problem.After I got that figured out, it probably took about 30 minutes to allow my cube to update and work at full capacity.But once the initial set up was done, I did have a few minor bugs for the first week. Sometimes I'd turn the TV off with the cube remote and audio would continue to play and I'd have to manually turn off the cube with it's physical button. This only happened two or three times.However, since pairing my alexa studios, this problem hasn't reoccured.Now I do have a switch that will trip my breaker if it accedntly gets flipped, and my cube and wifi are on the same breaker. So I do have to delete and repair my home theater when this happens, for some reason it completely ruins the connection and I'm not sure if it's because all my devices go offline, or if the cube can't reestablish connection on its own.Now, with all the quirks mentioned and dealt with. I love my fire cube!! Paired with my alexa studios watching TV or listening to music on my speaker group is awesome! There's one quirk about the home theater that irks me, but that's already been mentioned in my review for the studios.As for the cube itself though, I don't have any of the old issues I was having with my smart tv! Actually browsing different apps and my overall experience is much easier and intuitive! I love that I can use my voice to talk to the remote, or any of my alexa devices set to control the cube to immediately open an app or go straight to a movie or show. I got the remote Pro and I love the additional 2 custom buttons, along with the light up feature in the dark. And the ""find remote"" function works perfectly!! No more arguing over who lost the remote! LolMy partner was extremely skeptical about adding another alexa device to our home, he's not as tech savvy as I am, and he prefers to use his phone for smart controls. But even he has really enjoyed the fire cube! And honestly, that says a lot about this device!Initial setup may be rocky depending on person to person, but once it's running at full capacity, it's an excellent device for upgrading an existing TV that isn't smart, giving a second life to a smart TV that's having difficulty, and even for the home theater set up.If your buying a cube or fire stick for the theater set up, 1000% recommend two alexa studios. THIS WILL REPLACE ANY EXISTING AUDIO SET UP YOU HAVE THOUGH!!! theater mode cannot be paired with existing soundbars or other speakers.... Honestly not happy about that part... However!! The sound and quality I got from switching was worth it for me, though I had hoped to enhance my set up and not replace it...With that said, this is a perfect addition to your smart home journey.( would not recommend standard alexa speakers for home theater, even a cheap soundbar out performs two Alexas, but in my opinion, the alexa studios are a great trade even without the optional sub woofer.)The cube is capable of being a standalone alexa device if you don't have other devices, and on its own, the cube will play audio through a soundbar, TV, and I believe even an auxiliary audio source if you choose not to do a home theater with Alexa but don't quote me on that last one because I didn't try it.The cube can also easily pair to Bluetooth devices, so at night, I like to use my wireless earbuds without being too noisy.Like I said the cube can be a stand alone alexa device if you don't have any other alexa devices, so if your on the fence about a smart assistant, this could be a really great way to break into that, while still having a device that can do more than just being a smart assistant.",https://www.amazon.com/All-new-fire-tv-cube-4k-streaming-device/product-reviews/B09BZZ3MM7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1
Unknown,R1FUUCDB3S7BZI,Positive,"Amazon Fire TV Cube, Hands-free streaming device with Alexa, Wi-Fi 6E, 4K Ultra HD",4.5,5.0,"11,981","The first thing I noticed was how much faster everything is. Just moving around menus or opening apps is snappy and so much faster than the last model. Once in an app and watching something pausing, resuming, faster forwarding/rewinding are not just snappier but almost instant. I feel like that alone makes this so much better than gen 2 and was what annoyed me most about the old one. But the added I/O is a real step forward as well and going to be a big selling point for some as a reason to upgrade. The hdmi in works effortlessly and switches very quickly, the same menu now has a built in media browser/player for the usb port on the back and works well enough but streaming plex from a pc is still better if you want to do shows or binge. The ethernet is a really nice to have but is only 100mb (perfectly fine for most people!), but if have high speed internet ang good wifi you may want to use that. I have gigabit up and down and over wifi I got over 500mb not bad for wireless, for reference wired to my pc I get almost the full 1000mb up and down. I did notice things look sharper or more crisp and clear, I do not know if this is something new they are doing in the fire cube or just the new hardware is not holding back my old content, either way its a nice surprise. It even made my switch games feel a little more crisp (through the hdmi in port) so I feel like it may be a scaler.Now for the remote, I like it. I am actually am using it over my sofabaton that I love. its a little longer than the last model but not enough to really matter to most. The new buttons are great, a settings button for a new settings popup menu, a recents button (THANK YOU!), a live tv button which turns out to be useful.  You also get the volume up and down with a matching channel up and down now. And rounding out the selection at the bottom you also have 4 quick buttons, in the pictures it shows them as blank but they are actually paramount+, netflix, disney+ and hulu. And for programing them I have not found a way so that may only be for the premium version of the remote that will release later and if thats so then thats the one negative I have with what is a great remote.Alex function, It works like the old cube but it can reply and indicate through its own speaker without using the tv or soundbar which is really nice. Not really a lot you can say about this part just that there is no noticeable negatives I ran into.If upgrading you can use you old Ir emitter from the gen 2. My sofabaton universal remote still works on the new model just fine didnt even need to reprogram it just paired its bluetooth through the cube and it was happy. Over all Its a great upgrade well worth it.If you are getting this as a first time fire cube owner or streaming box owner keep in mind you will want to also buy a nice hdmi cable for this as it does not come with one. And if you want to use an IR emitter (for stuff in like a closed entertainment center) you will also need to get that separately this time but it uses the same as the one that came with the gen 2 and can be purchased cheaply.",https://www.amazon.com/All-new-fire-tv-cube-4k-streaming-device/product-reviews/B09BZZ3MM7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1
Unknown,R3QR3ZQAH1EFFL,Positive,"Amazon Fire TV Cube, Hands-free streaming device with Alexa, Wi-Fi 6E, 4K Ultra HD",4.5,4.0,"11,981","I needed to upgrade my 1st gen cube.  So much lag......so much loooonnnnggggg lag.....that I was sick of it, but I like the ease of use and felt I got my moneys worth, so I bought this new one.  Installed it and it works great.  Much faster and more responsive.... did what I expected it to do and I'm happy with it.  The problem, or is it pure coincidence?, is that the Fire Stick on my TV in the bedroom would not work (beyond the logo freeze) right after installing the new cube in the living room.  I reset and reset and reset per every video I could find on how to, and no luck getting it out of the logo freeze to perform.  Have never had any trouble with this fire stick.  So, I put my old cube, which still worked (slow but worked), on that TV.  It comes on with voice recognition but absolutely will not pair with its remote, and per all my uses, I need the remote to work.  I tried all the tricks there, too, and maybe one out of 10 tries did it pair and work for the time that the TV was on for that setting only.  Once the TV was off, it wouldn't pair or work the next time I turned it on.  Voice worked, but not the remote.  Pretty frustrating and hard to believe it is all coincidence.  These are issues I had no trouble with prior to setting up the new cube.  So now, I've ordered a new Fire Stick for that room and we'll see.Update & follow-up after getting the new Fire-Stick:  The new 4K Max Fire-stick installed quickly and perfectly on my bedroom Sony Aquos Tv, and I had no remote pairing or other issues.  So the problems I had after installing the new 3rd Gen Cube last week had nothing to do with my equipment.  Therefore, I do tend to believe that the new generation cube just did not like my old 1st generation cube or fire-stick (or vice-versa).  Anyway, all is working great now and I'm still happy with my Fire-Tv streaming devices.",https://www.amazon.com/All-new-fire-tv-cube-4k-streaming-device/product-reviews/B09BZZ3MM7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1
Unknown,R1GXUR2WUDHLT4,Positive,"Amazon Fire TV Cube, Hands-free streaming device with Alexa, Wi-Fi 6E, 4K Ultra HD",4.5,5.0,"11,981","I've had my 2019 Cube for close to 3 years. Definitely got my money's worth out of it. I've owned other devices and still own a 2017 Shield. The Cube has been my daily driver for a few years though because I love how everything integrates and Android TV just doesn't do it for me. I use my Shield for other things and my Cube for my paid apps. I bought the 3rd gen Cube the day it was available for pre-order, along with the Pro remote which isn't released yet. I bought it because my 2nd gen was getting really laggy and it was enough to irritate me. The upscaling (Super Resolution) is what I was most excited for though. I received my Cube on Monday, a day before I was supposed to. I immediately plugged it in. I have it hooked up to my 65"" Vizio OLED with an $80 Audioquest HDMI cable. I turned on The First 48 which is only a 1080p show and was blown away by the results. It looked so good in comparison to my 2nd gen. Everything looks better, the menus, the picture, the color is more vivid, everything. (I know Always HDR mode was enabled in the picture, it comes enabled by default and I just hadn't disabled it yet.) The GPU along with the upscaling is a major improvement by the looks of it. The new processor is really good as well. It's very quick. It will scroll through menus as fast as I can push the button and loads images instantly. There's a new menu button to the left of the home button on the screen as my picture shows, that you can switch to the HDMI input. I haven't tested this input as of yet. There's a few new items in settings as well. The Cube itself is also a huge improvement. I think it looks 10x better than the 2nd gen. 2nd gen was nice, but the piano black plastic scratches as soon as you touch it, even with micro fiber so I haven't liked that material much. The new Cube has matte plastic around the top and bottom housed by a black-greyish fabric. It's really nice looking (same as the new Echo Dots) The speaker (Amazon Echo built-in) sounds alot better too. All-in-all I think it's a huge improvement from the 2nd gen and I'm so glad they FINALLY upgraded the Cube and that it kept its design. Really the only other thing I can think of that needs changed is to make it a 3gb RAM box. It's 2022, yet we're still using the same amount of RAM as the 2019 Cube. I just have a feeling in a year or two, this 2gb RAM on this device isn't gonna be enough and it's gonna struggle, but I guess we'll see. I can't comment on Wifi 6e as I haven't upgraded my wifi yet, but I will eventually. But right now I don't have a reason too. As far as the regular remote that comes with it, I guess it's a nice remote, I'm just not a fan of all the added buttons. I much prefer the 2nd gen Alexa remote that has your standard buttons plus the volume and mute at the bottom. I just prefer the simplicity of it and don't like the clutter of the new one. Also, new remote that came with mine has really loud clicks. It's rather annoying. I know it's not cause my old remote is worn, cause it's been pretty quiet since I bought it (not the original remote that came with the 2nd gen Cube) so either the new ones are just really loud or I just got a bad one, which has happened to me with a remote I've had on a previous device and had to exchange it cause it was so annoying. I am waiting on the Pro remote which has even more buttons but I bought it for the backlit buttons. While it has a couple more buttons than the Fire TV remote that came with it, it's smaller in size. Pro remote is 5.8"" and Fire TV remote that came with it is 6.2"". My 2nd gen Alexa remote that I bought for my 2nd gen Cube is 5.6"" so I'm sure I'll like the Pro remote a whole lot better. So with all that said, I am still happy with my purchase and am glad I decided to upgrade.",https://www.amazon.com/All-new-fire-tv-cube-4k-streaming-device/product-reviews/B09BZZ3MM7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1
Unknown,RDRO6T7Q2CR8G,Positive,"Amazon Fire TV Cube, Hands-free streaming device with Alexa, Wi-Fi 6E, 4K Ultra HD",4.5,5.0,"11,981","So I bought a FireTV Cube to test a theory.I spent many hours configuring/tweaking my network settings, complaining to my ISP about suspected protocol throttling, running Cat6 ethernet drops to all TV locations throughout my house, I could never get the Amazon Prime app, Pluto app, Netflix app, Tubi app, to function/perform on any of my AppleTV 4K's (Ver2) as well or as fast as the native AppleTV apps such as AppleTV+ and AppleMovies.Even though my throughput was 485-495Mbps, as measured by my Unifi network controller and/or by the Ookla app installed on the AppleTV itself.  I would constantly experience pixellation, buffering, and slow menu response while using these afore mentioned non-Apple apps.Upon exhaustive reading on blogs, message boards, and reviews from around the net, I discovered this was a common, but not necessarily a universal problem.Thus I began to wonder if the problem might lay with the AppleTV hardware, or maybe the implementation of the various apps on the AppleTV platform.So I decided to tryout a FireTV Cube, and all I have to say is WOW!It worked out of the box, no problems whatsoever; not one.All the afore mentioned non-Apple apps worked flawlessly on the FireTV Cube.  No more pixellation, buffering, or slow menus.This was an unbelievably simple and affordable fix.  I had already wasted so much time and effort troubleshooting the problems I had with the AppleTV 4K's; I might have paid double the price for these the FireTV Cube if I knew in advance the FireTV Cube was the solution to my problems.Let me also comment on the Amazon Alexa Voice Remote Pro.  I would definitely recommend it as an upgrade to the FireTV Cube.  The automatic backlight feature of the Amazon Alexa Voice Remote Pro is GREAT!  This remote far outshines the AppleTV 4K's remote by leaps and bounds.  The ""clicky"" buttons provide accurate control and positive feedback, which is much more than I can say for the AppleTV remote.  Only one caveat to the Amazon Alexa Voice Remote Pro, is the rounded back; I don't like it.Now anyone reading this might assume I am an Apple hater.  I definitely am not.  I switched over to Apple many years ago, and never looked back.  Every computer in my house is an Apple except for the one I use for HDD testing.  I love our Apple computers.  I love our iPhones.  Unfortunately, I cannot say the same thing for our AppleTVs  IMHO, streaming on the AppleTVs with Apple native apps is great, but with non-Apple apps it falls short.  However I will definitely miss the AppleTVs tight integration/control with my AirPods.However, streaming those same non-Apple apps on the Amazon FireTV is nothing short of AWESOME!HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!Hope this helps!",https://www.amazon.com/All-new-fire-tv-cube-4k-streaming-device/product-reviews/B09BZZ3MM7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1

Unknown,R1EA2B0N2HPH2A,Positive,"Amazon Fire TV Cube, Hands-free streaming device with Alexa, Wi-Fi 6E, 4K Ultra HD",4.5,4.0,"11,981","I am a big fan of Amazon products.  I have FireTV products going back to the stick.  I currently use my FireTV (Gen3), FireTV Cube (Gen2), and FireTV Cube (Gen3).  Comparing FireTV Cube (Gen 2) with FireTV (Gen3), I am displeased with the external speaker in Gen3--it is muffly sounding and the internal microphone is less sensitive than Gen2.  Setting up my Xfinity Cable TV box with Gen3 is easier than Gen2 because Gen3 has a built-in direct HDMI input connector for the cable box but you need to select the input in FireTV Cube and be sure you change it from HDMI to Cable and FireTV Cube (Gen3) will then properly setup your cable TV box location and programming guide; sometimes FireTV Cube (Gen3) cannot passthrough the TV's Dolby audio signal and there's no sound when using Cable TV.  The solution is to set the FireTV Cube (Gen3) to PCM audio.  Setting up my Samsung Soundbar was better in Gen3 than Gen2 because when the soundbar model series is not found FireTV Cube (Gen3) like mine which is a new soundbar and not found by FireTV Cube the software will allow you to manually setup compatibility using the soundbar remote control but you have to go through the whole setup process before it will give you this option this is dumb and it needs to be a readily accessible option in the settings software. It also takes much longer to program this way but it works better than not having the specific soundbar model number listed in FireTV Cube.  Setting up my new Sony Bravia UHD 75-inch TV was smooth and no issues there.  Try not to change any software settings in your TV and FireTV unless you start having issues and work the issues one step at a time. A big disapoinment with FireTV Cube (Gen3) is that it no longer let's you sideload apps as easily as Gen2 which only required allowing unknown sources and using the Downloader App to install apps that are not in the Amazon AppStore. So far I have not seen a way to override security features in the Android-based operating system to allow third-party apps to be installed in FireTV Cube (Gen3).  Making FireTV Cube (Gen3) work smoothly with Amazon Alexa Skills and the Alexa App is no fun experience either.  Depending on how many FireTV Cubes and other FireTV devices you have in your home it can cause all sorts of voice command problems.  The best thing to do is rename all your devices in the Alexa App to the specific FireTV location where the device is connected, for example, if you have a FireTV Cube in your family room and also in your bedroom then name the devices ""Family Room TV"" and ""Main Bedroom TV"" and do the same for your CableTV Boxes listed in the Alexa App.  Alexa will eventually learn your devices and you can send voice commands without unexpected results.  Nonetheless, the Alexa App software working with FireTV is a bit glitchy and needs refinement. Overall, I recommend FireTV Cube (Gen3) and I hope Amazon will push software improvements on a regular basis for the Alexa App and FireTV Cube.UPDATE 6-3-23I was able to find some compatibility settings in my Comcast Cable Box that helped fix the audio somtimes not passing through to FireTV Cube.  If you have a Comcast Cable Box check that your audio is set to the advanced audio settings and make sure your HDMI is set to pass through to your TV.After having repeat problems with my FireTV Cube not properly communicating with my compatible Samsung Soundbar with FireTV Cube somtimes muting but not unmuting the sound when sending voice commands to Alexa to change the cable channel, or lower/raise the volume, or ask about anything such as weather, time, etc. while the TV and soundbar are on. The conflict in the two devices turned out to be a simple issue.  If you connect your soundbar to your TV using the ARC HDMI port then you don't need to setup your soundbar with FireTV Cube because when you already setup your TV with FireTV Cube the soundbar is automatically controlled through ARC. When a voice command is sent to Alexa on FireTV Cube the TV will handle the voice commands and pass the signal to your soundbar via ARC.  This was a very annoying issue and there wasn't any help on FireTV Cube to guide the customer about it.UPDATE 4-18-23Fire TV Cube Gen 3 is still glitchy at times with Alexa running slow or not responsive to voice commands and because the cable box is now connected directly to the Fire TV Cube there are sometimes glitches in the sound.  These issues are not frequent but still annoying.  If you want to access Developer Options you need to select in Settings > My Fire TV > About, and click on ""About"" several times until the Developer Options are activated.  You can then turn on ADB Debugging and Unknown Sources.  Keep in mind that every app you access that is used to install third-party apps will need to be approved in Developer Options, so if you use the Downloader app to access a third-party app it won't install the app you downloaded until you agree to allow Downloader to access apps from Unknown Sources.  You only need to do this once.  You can also install apps directly from the USB port on the back of the device.  You can format the USB drive in NTFS and save the APK file from your PC to the USB drive then plug the USB drive into your Fire TV Cube to install the APK file.  There is a simple File Explorer app in the Amazon appstore that works well to access the flash drive to install the APK file.  You can also use ES File Explorer but this app has a lot of other features and you can get the installation done fast with the simple File Explorer app.  Good luck and enjoy your Fire TV Cube Gen 3.",https://www.amazon.com/All-new-fire-tv-cube-4k-streaming-device/product-reviews/B09BZZ3MM7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1

Unknown,R3JP0NBOFJRV5Q,Positive,"Amazon Fire TV Cube, Hands-free streaming device with Alexa, Wi-Fi 6E, 4K Ultra HD",4.5,4.0,"11,981","So.. I managed to get all 5 TV's switched to fire TV cube Gen3.  The cube itself seems well made and has some nice heft to it.  In my home I have the top of the line orbi 6e wifi mesh and therefore I do not require an ethernet connection.  At some point I may connect one of these boxes to ethernet but I suspect that will create problems with my echo studio home theatre configurations.The good:Fast and responsive operation.Quick boot upGood mic that detects commands well.Plays all content with some minor issues that I will get to.The ability to include fire tv command in routines is helpful.. although far too limited.  I was able to use routines to overcome some of the limitations and oversights in the software. E.g. not having a sufficient list of equipment names to choose from when setting up equipment as I talk about further down.The dissappointing..Equipment control has a ways to go (key points)1. Powering on and off your equipment is not usually a problem..  you can use the remote or your voice and say turn on TV..  Alexa fire tv cube turns on all necessary equipment including tv.. soundbar.. receiver etc, and switches devices to the correct input... that is where the good ends..2. Try asking fire tv cube to play a song or watch a show while all of you equipment is off.. she will wake up and turn on maybe one of your necessary devices... but leave everything else off making that functionality useless.  I have 5 of these cube.. some of them will only turn on the TV.. some the receiver.. and one of them actually turns on both for some inexplicable reason but does not take you to the app or content requested and instead leaves you stuck at the profile window.  At least of 4 of my setups I can confirm that when Alexa is asked to play content she can only power on devices that are directly connected with an HDMI cable.  Not a huge issue i guess...  stupidly you have to issue 2 commands..  Alexa turn on tv followed by Alexa play music by AC/DC..  surely a simple code fix could address this.3. Gets out of sync.. it will not power on or off a piece of equipment properly.. and then the power state of your entire home theatre setup is out of sync..  you ask alexa to ""turn on tv"" because your receiver didn't power on with last command and she will turn on your receiver but then shutoff tv..4. You are limited to only a handful of names for your equipment that have been pre selected by Amazon developers.. so if you have a pc connected go your home theatre as I do.. you are out of luck.. you will need to give it a name from the limited options on the list of devices.  I chose Game Console.  This is just dumb and users should be able to choose names for their devices.  A pc is a pretty common device to have on the big screen..come on Amazon!!The frustrating but not terribly bad.1. I have 2 of my fire TV cubes connected each with an echo studio stereo pair with echo sub..  Amazon calls this configurative a ""Home Theatre Group"".  The sound quality is good.  Problem is that sometimes you cannot get the sound to work..I believe it is related to using the Home Theater group as the default speaker group for your room..so when I ask for music the music starts playing on the theater group.. however later on when I turn on the TV.. the music stops..but no TV sound comes through the Home theater group.. I have had to reboot.. unplug and replug alexa to get the sound to start working again.2.  When I play his res audio through amazon music to my echo studio group she can only process 16bit  48khz even though music tracks are 24bit 196khz.  Amazon says device capability is limited.  This is of course stupid as well since the echo studio is supposed to be able to play the highest quality possible.I have spent hours tweaking everything to run as well as possible.. and have even wasted a few hours on the phone with the customer service.. folks if you have rebooted your device.. unplugged and replugged.. performed a factory reset.. there is no point in calling support.  They are friendly and professional but of no use beyond very basic troubleshooting.  They cannot help you with improperly performing functions beyond the very simple steps mentioned above.. so if those don't resolve your problems to a satisfactory level.. just return the device and move on or wait and hope for a fix in a future software update.",https://www.amazon.com/All-new-fire-tv-cube-4k-streaming-device/product-reviews/B09BZZ3MM7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1

It would honestly be easier and less effort for them if they just did it right in the first place, I'm sure.For instance, you can't play music from a memory device or hear the radio when you're connected to Android Auto. You just can't. Playback is immediately cut off as soon as you connect. There is no option anywhere to make this not happen, so you can't play music and have a map up at the same time, unless you stream music off of your phone. So what's the point of having a memory card slot in the first place? Don't try to tell me this is some kind of ""Android Auto limitation."" The factory stereo in a family member's Cadillac from ~2017 can do this just fine, and if even General Motors of all people can get it right for once I can't see why this has to be half baked.There is no way to toggle the Android Auto ""automatically connect"" option without brute-force causing the initial connection to fail by putting your phone in airplane mode, because the menu where this option is hidden is literally inaccessible if you have the head unit paired to your phone. This is documented nowhere in the manual. You'll have a devil of a time figuring it out. In the meantime, you'll get four seconds of music every time you turn on your car, then it will cut out abruptly as the unit tries to connect to your phone instead without your input. This circles back around to the above point.There is a bug in the software that makes the ""now playing"" screen erroneously display your music's track name as the album title. That's not the end of the world; it's just dumb. Tell me no one beta tested this without telling me.The Android Auto interface does work, but it is painfully slow. Touches on the screen take 1-2 seconds to respond and are sometimes dropped altogether. It's a little better over a wired connection rather than wireless, but not by much.There is no way to power off the screen for night driving without turning off the entire unit altogether. Likewise, the LED lighting in the controls does not dim when you turn on your headlights, even though the screen does. That's okay, I'll just be blind, I guess?Your volume settings are not remembered after power off, so whenever you start your car it goes back to the default.Etc., etc.The documentation this comes with is not terribly helpful, and in some cases is outright inaccurate. I found out the hard way, for instance, that this unit natively supports steering wheel controls that work via analog resistance values. The manual says nothing about this and simply insists that you ""need"" a steering wheel control interface module in all circumstances. This is not the case, and in fact my unit would not work reliably with my existing Metra ASWC-1 module. Once I ripped that out and connected the wires directly, the steering wheel controls were MORE reliable, but still not 100% because every handful of startups the unit just completely forgets all of its button assignments.The alleged manufacturer's ""support"" is also a joke. Their web page is just a Shopify store, and in order to get updated firmware (which did not fix any of the above issues or bugs, insofar as I can tell) you must message them and wait for them to email you some Google Drive links to the files. Why are these not just posted on their web site? Who knows. And if you ask their support any question that is outside of their script they'll just ignore you. (Like the album title thing.) And their preferred method of contact is for you to message them on Facebook of all places? That is astoundingly unprofessional. Their Facebook page is thus an endless conga line of people begging for product help and firmware update files over and over and over and over again.I have this installed in my car and at this point honestly I'm too lazy to rip it out and return it. It ""works,"" after a fashion, but not really satisfactorily. I used to replace a stereo that was outright broken, so I guess it's better than what I started with which was nothing. When I go to replace this one, though, I'll go back to using something name brand.",https://www.amazon.com/PLZ-Wireless-Bluetooth-Receivers-Subwoofers/product-reviews/B0CFL3MFXF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1

My automatic antenna stays up. Even if I press and hold the power button and power off the radio screen, the antenna stays up. An email to customer support confirms that is 'normal'.

The EQ is definitely less than stellar and lacks important options like high pass/low pass filters and bass adjustment without a seperate subwoofer connected. You just get a 10 band EQ with a handful of mediocre presets, plus fade/balance and toggleable loudness. This makes my factory amp+aftermarket speaker setup sound not so great when it sounded fantastic with a different stereo with proper audio settings.

My unit arrived missing piece of the wiring harness. I contacted them via facebook and had a replacement harness in less than 4 days.For the price this has great features. I mostly like the phone link capability for music and GPS MapsIt was a straightforward install for people that know their way around a car's wiring system.It is a little quirky and time will tell if it will hold up. I bought the protection plan, because I just don't think it will based on my experience with inexpensive stereos on Amazon.Some of the quirks/issues:It is slow. It takes 1-2 seconds for the backup camera to engage. Not a big deal but you will notice if you have modern cars with integrated backup camera.About every other day the Android car play connect forgets my phone and has to be paired again.After about 4 days of use it started doing this thing where when it first comes on it acts like it is making a phone call through my phone. It isn't really doing anything but I have to touch the hangup icon on the unit to get to the home screen.It is slow to connect to my phone. It always takes about 10-20 seconds after I turn my truck on. If I put it in reverse before it is done, I have to reconnect manually to phone after I start to drive.It isn't very loud. The wattage rating on this is exaggerated. It sounds good but just not very loud.Not sure if this is from my phone service, but it takes awhile to buffer up streamed music. I usually just hit pause for a few seconds and it works. I can listen on my phone by itself and I don't get this situation.All that said, If it is still working in a year, I would say it is worth the price.Update 1: Customer service is nice and responsive. I was originally missing a piece of wiring harness and they had it two me in three days.

I installed on a 2012 Subaru Impreza. I definitely needes the separate dash kit (the included fascia and brackets did not fit) and wiring harness (I got the harness with included steering wheel control wiring and was able to retain most of the steering wheel controls without needing the separate adapter). Double check what you need for your specific make/model.Install was actually fairly easy, just make sure you pay attention to the wiring diagrams. I used a cheap crimp kit from Harbor Freight to get the job done. Installing the backup camera was a bit more tricky (had to splice into the reverse light and drill a few holes) but you'll be fine if you watch a few YouTube videos.Setup is also pretty straightforward. Android Auto works great and the stereo sounds at least as good as, if not better, than the factory stereo. The fridge default screen settings are a bit dim and murky, so I boosted the brightness and saturation settings to improve it. Backup camera works great. Some reviews have complained about the camera having permanent alignment grids in the field of view but that was not the case for mine. The only grids in mine are adjustable and removable in the head unit software. Additionally, their support email is very fast and responsive (although you may have to decipher some of their odd English at times).It isn't perfect. Occasionally the Bluetooth doesn't pair on its own and requires manual pairing. The screen quality is good, but not great (I think they have a more expensive QLED model). The steering wheel control settings don't have an option for a ""mic"" or ""voice"" button, which means if you have that button on your wheel you won't be able to use it to active Siri or Google Assistant. These are minor quibbles, especially if you go to Crutchfield and compare to even your least expensive option for wireless Carplay/Android, backup camera, etc, which will be at least 400 bucks.If your car is already kind of old and not worth spending a ton of money on a state of the art head unit, this is a very inexpensive option that will get you 90% of the functionality of a brand name unit that costs you triple.

I didn't have high expectations of this replacement, but I'm pleasantly surprised so far.It was an easy install, as I already had a wiring harness and bracket for the old 7"" HU, and previously installed rear camera and wiring.The screen is considerably better than the Pioneer it replaced, and the sound is fantastic. I really like the physical volume knobs and all of the function buttons being on the left side of the unit. I really like wireless Android Auto connection, but it has some issues as detailed below.What I don't like, and why it doesn't get 5 stars: you can't listen to the radio and have android auto running. The old unit, you could. So, you don't get navigation prompts or a map if you want to listen to the radio. That was solved by an I Heart Radio app, and thankfully I have unlimited data on my phone plan. But I can see it would be an issue for some, and should be something a software update could fix.I also have the occasional android auto connection issue. Sometimes it automatically connects when I start the car, sometimes it doesn't, and sometimes it takes 5-10 minutes to connect. It also uses wifi to connect, not just Bluetooth.  This is annoying, and sometimes I have to shut the car off, wait for the unitbto power down, and restart the car to get the unit and phone to connect. When it works, though, I really like it.I also HATE the built in mic on the unit. It's tiny, and far away. People say they can hear me, but I sound like I'm in a tunnel. There's seemingly no place to install an external mic (at least no where that I could install my pre-existing external mic). It's functional, but problematic.

This radio is awesome for the price. Lets talk about about my experience with it so far.Receiving (9/10)- Everything came in and in good condition, no missing pieces and the box wasn't damages.Parts (8/10)- It comes with the radio, remote, and a rear view camera. I would really like to see companies stop including remotes, and start including tempered glass screen protectors with touch screen units.Installation (9/10)- Everything is properly labeled, the instructions are translated good enough to understand what you're doing if this is the first time you're installing a head unit.Operation (7/10)- While the screen is very responsive, it does have its hiccups, I can't fault it much for that because a name brand radio from one of the bigger comies is going to be over double the price with the same features or less. It loses stars here because you will need to contact PLZ to add a new background or boot logo for them to send you the update files (more on this later).Bluetooth (9/10)- No complaints here, works good, no stuttering issues, connects fast and easy.Apple CarPlay (9/10)- It seems like the apple carplay works good. I'm personally an android user, but I used my father's Iphone to test this feature.Android Auto (5/10-9/10)- This is where it get's odd. Android auto was kinda bad at first, it connected fast and easy but the audio quality was TERRIBLE. It didn't matter if I went into the admin settings and tuned it, it didn't matter if I tuned it with the EQ, it was BAD, rewarding it 5/10. I was going to get over this issue because I installed the radio in a truck I don't drive much. Anyhow, I reached out to PLZ to get the boot screen changed to ""ford"" to match the truck. They sent me the file for it along with a MCU and BT update. After the update the android auto appeared to be fixed! 9/10 at the end of the day.Customer Service (10/10)- Not a whole lot to say here, but dealing with them was super easy. When they send you the update files they include written instructions and a video link for how to install the updates! All you need is a USB drive that is formatted to the newest rev. of FAT.Summary- The unit is great, the customer service is great, the price is GREAT.

Initially, I was skeptical about its low price, but now that I've installed and used it, I can confidently say it's a fantastic value for the money.First and foremost, the PLZ receiver exceeded my expectations in terms of features. It offers a plethora of functions, far more than I anticipated at this price point. From wireless Android connectivity to camera support to a shallow mounting depth, it checked off all the boxes on my list of requirements.The support provided by PLZ was exceptional. Clear instructions were included for pre-installation testing, and the option for a system update was a pleasant surprise. Not only did the update enhance the functionality of the receiver, but I also had the opportunity to personalize it with images for the startup splash screen and wallpaper. Additionally, they can provide emblems for some car makes upon request.  I did not need those since I already had images I wanted to use, but that could be helpful for some. Despite support being overseas, their prompt responses to my emails waiting for me in my inbox each morning were greatly appreciated.The wireless integration with Android Auto is a standout feature of the PLZ receiver. In the confined space of a Corvette, the convenience of not having to worry about cable management is a huge plus. Now, I can keep my phone tucked away in my pocket or console while still accessing all the essential controls and apps through the receiver's touchscreen. Streaming music and navigation have never been easier.Installation was made even simpler thanks to the RCA out connections, which allowed me to seamlessly integrate the receiver with my Rockford Fosgate amp and speakers. The resulting audio quality is impressive, especially considering the compact interior of the C4 Corvette.Lastly, the sleek design of the PLZ receiver blends in with my car's all-black dash, exceeding my expectations for it looking like it belongs there.  I have seen so many aftermarket installs in C4s that just look out of place, so I am pleased to not be in that group.  My one remaining task is to modify the plastic trim piece to fit the size of the receiver, but that is due to my car and not the unit.  I have installed many stereos over the years and if my car had a standard double din opening this would have been a simple bolt-in install.  But that is my car’s issue, not the receivers.Overall, the PLZ Wireless 7"" Car Receiver has proven to be the perfect fit for my needs, offering an unbeatable combination of features, value, and support.  I would not hesitate to purchase this unit again when the need arises.

I started looking for a new unit that supported wireless Android Auto.  Pioneer wanted over $400. I decided to see what Amazon had to offer. I read the reviews and decided on the P.L.Z unit for less than one third the cost of a Pioneer unit. I am very happy with the new P.L.Z head unit.I used my existing Metra 95-8214TG Double Din dash kit and a new Red Wolf wiring harness to install the head unit in the Tacoma. The process was fairly simple and the new P.L.Z unit fits very well. I connected the new unit to my existing backup camera and a new external microphone.Wireless Android Auto worked well from the start. Either Waze or Google maps or music apps were displayed quickly and clearly. The sound is very good.  I like having a knob to control the volume. I can quickly mute the sound by pushing the knob.I have contacted support several times with questions and to upgrade the s/w. They responded within a day to my queries.  Their support is very good.Buy this great product and save some money.,https://www.amazon.com/PLZ-Wireless-Bluetooth-Receivers-Subwoofers/product-reviews/B0CFL3MFXF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1

The touchscreen and UI are super responsive and there is zero lag or freezing so far. To add, the UI is neat and very easy to use. One neat feature is the ability to detach the touchscreen from the head unit for those who may not live in the nicest area and park on the street like myself. In addition, the display tilts and swivels which is a nice touch; the unit feels sturdy while tilting or swiveling it as well, giving you a feeling of confidence while doing so.THE BAD: Where this head unit seriously falls short is in the sound quality department. I have four Rockford Fosgate Punch 6x8 3-way speakers hooked up to this head unit and they sounded far better with my old JVC head unit. The output from this head unit makes high end speakers sound very thin, and the volume is capped at 40; even at the max volume with the loudness setting turned on, this radio does not get loud at all. In addition, EQ settings are severely limited: There is no option to adjust bass, treble, mids, etc. Instead, you are stuck with EQ sliders which help only marginally on this head unit. One other area where this head unit falls short is with the Bluetooth audio quality. When taking calls over Bluetooth, the other caller sounds very robotic. Lastly, while using CarPlay, you cannot listen to AM/FM radio simultaneously, which is not an issue with my BOSS CarPlay head unit in my other vehicle.Overall, this head unit is worth the $219.00 asking price due to it's solid build quality and easy to use UI.If you want a head unit with better sound quality and more sound customization, I suggest spending more for a name-brand unit.",https://www.amazon.com/PLZ-Wireless-Bluetooth-Receivers-Subwoofers/product-reviews/B0CFL3MFXF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1

AAND I installed it. I bought the SCOSCHE Install Centric ICFD6BN Aftermarket connection kit, and only used the harness for my 2008 Ford F150.  Saved the plastic bracket crap for later: nothing matched up, so I couldn't use the Scosche nonsense plastic brackets. Took me a while, but I actually just used the trim and brackets that came with this unit, and tweaked them a bit, I mean a lot, to get those (4) screws in to replace the outdated stock unit. Actually looks quite good, but took some work.My first impressions: LOUD. This head unit is very good at outputting much, much more than my original stock stereo. Listened to A7X ""Scream"" at 40 volume with ""Rock"" EQ, and Loudness on, and I had to turn it down. Man, that sounded good.Bluetooth Connection: at first, Apple CarPlay worked fine, several times, in and out of the truck. Then, it wouldn't connect. At all.Had to reset my phone, reset the head unit. Try again. Nothing. ""Enter 0000"" it says. All the time.Also, as others have noted, there is no way to listen to local radio when connected to CarPlay. Big bummer. It's a different App with this stereo, so I kind of understand. I can get by with installed apps on iPhone, like Audacy, or others. But it would be nice to have this option.Mirror is a nightmare so far. I can't figure out a way to go from Bluetooth to Mirror. Perhaps it's not available. This software/firmware out of the box is sketchy at best. If I am connected via BT, the mirror option is NOT AVAILABLE. AT ALL. And vice-versa, and so on and so forth.At first, when connecting to CarPlay via BT, it was flawless, then suddenly, it would connect for music, but not CarPlay. Boo PLZ. Substandard at best.So right out the gate I asked them for software/firmware upgrade via email,  as suggested with the paper insert, and I must admit they responded quite quickly. I also asked for a Ford logo. They sent me (2) links. I have not yet installed these, but when I do I will update. Hopefully this will take care of the BT connection issues, which are a deal-breaker for me. If this update takes care of my connection issues, I will update stars. If not, well, I'll rip it out and stars go down. I bought this for CarPlay. I can look past radio vs. CarPlay.So far, this head unit has very good sound and plenty of options. I bought this for ease of CarPlay. So if this is not resolved via firmware upgrade, I'll yank it out and go with an Alpine.They did ask me for a positive review for a free front camera (normal for Chinese intros), and since I've not yet installed the included rear camera, I will reserve my positive review for if this thing actually works for what I bought it for in the first place, which is seamless CarPlay. So far, before the impending firmware, I am impressed with the sound. But not the connectivity. Update to follow.UPDATE 7/15/24: So the two files sent to me were the FORD Boot logo, and the instructions. When I compared the version installed via flask drive vs. version updated, they were exactly the same. 20240307. This tells me that the firmware/software was not updated (I believe), and that the latest is from March 7. Not looking good. The FORD boot logo does look nice, and my BT CarPlay connection has not dropped as much as in the past. But that could also be a fluke; time will tell. Will update soon.UPDATE 7/30/24: I have had random disconnects with CarPlay, but overall the system has responded. Caveats below:1. When the system seems to be stuck in a loop with CarPlay, I turn off the vehicle, take the phone away (not sure if this is necessary), then get back in, start, and everything connects properly. My takeaway: Even though the head unit could be turned off with the power button while vehicle is in use, the head unit DOES NOT cycle power, because it is always connected to ACC. Cycling power via the key (and for some, opening the door) ACTUALLY turns off the unit. Then it will allow it to attempt to re-connect. This worked for me.2. I bought a third-party reverse camera, and hooked it up to this unit, and it works well. ANOTHER CAVEAT I have noticed is that while connecting this unit to your phone via Bluetooth (like getting in the vehicle and starting it), if you cycle to the reverse to activate the camera during the Bluetooth connection process, it could be wonky. In my experience, it connected via Bluetooth and annunciated, but would not show the map. My advice is to let the unit connect first. This takes a whole 5 seconds out of your day. The HORRORS.3. It is clear that the native radio, while using, will not allow you to view the map from your phone, but it does annunciate turn direction. My workaround was to install Audacy and others, because I prefer to listen to radio. For others that prefer their normal streaming, this is probably not an issue.One thing I have been doing is ripping DVD movies onto micro SD. I use MakeMKV, then use Handbrake to convert to MP4, with (need to select) MP3 audio, and +20 Gain. THIS IS THE FORMAT YOU WILL NEED TO BE USED WITH THIS HEAD UNIT. Works pretty well, and my kids can watch movies on this unit while driving down the road. Bonus is the micro SD fits snugly in the upper right corner (its home), and your saved MKV files can always be used to convert to other formats.So far, it's been a pretty good cheap unit, so I upgraded to 4 stars.Will update later.UPDATE 9/4/24: Unit still working well, and is connecting more reliably; perhaps because I have learned to adapt to the unit, and not the other way around. Upgraded stock paper 25W speakers to Polk Audio DB+572s F+R and sounds a bit better. I noticed that this unit’s EQ is not what I expected; with new speakers I leave on Flat EQ and sounds pretty good with Loudness on. Using “Rock” EQ at high volume sounds very distorted; garbage. Hope this helps some. Does not take advantage of speakers yet, due to what I have found is low output. The exaggeration of output reported by other reviewers is indeed accurate.Still sounds good with minimal fiddling, but wondering if an amp would help vs. Alpine or Pioneer replacement head. Will update later…",https://www.amazon.com/PLZ-Wireless-Bluetooth-Receivers-Subwoofers/product-reviews/B0CFL3MFXF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1
Unknown,RN2XIKSYW8E3Y,Positive,"PLZ 7"" Wireless Double Din Car Stereo Apple Carplay Radio Screen for Car Audio Receivers, Bluetooth 5.3 Car Play Android Auto Touchscreen, 240W 4.2 CHN 2 Subwoofers Outputs, Backup Camera, SWC, FM/AM",4.2,5.0,"1,369","Overall, I thought this digital car display was an excellent product! I thought it was appropriately priced and does everything it says does. I was a little hesitant that it would fit my car which is an old 1999 Toyota Corolla, however, it fit very well, although I had to take the harness that it came with off. I was also surprised that the brackets for the original cassette player that I was replacing this digital display with fit perfectly on this device. The dashboard cover mostly fits back onto the dashboard, except a little on the b bottom, but it's not really noticeable as the screen covers that; the vents also still work well. I also had to go and buy a cable that converts the connectors in my Toyota Corolla to the standard ISO connectors that connect to the back of this digital display (labeled A and B on the back of the device). For anyone interested, I got it for $12 here: https://a.co/d/0x2yaSTThis connector works for most Toyota models (the supported models are listed on the item page, but I'd still recommend checking to make sure they will work for your car model).The display is a little big for my car, as shown in the pictures since it covers the vents and some of the air controls below. I don't really mind this, however. I like that it's a really big display and easy to see. The display has a micro SD card reader and can also read from USB drives. From this, you can play videos, view photos, and listen to music stored on the device. The radio works fairly well and the original radio antenna fits into the back of this digital display. The sound from the radio is a little muffled, however, but I don't really use the radio much, so it wasn't a problem.A phone connected with Bluetooth has two ways of interfacing with with digital display. The built-in software of the device can do some basic functions like play music, receive calls, and make calls, which seem to work fairly well. I don't really use this feature as Android Auto has all of these features, plus a lot more. The device supports both wired and wireless Android Auto and Apple Carplay. However, I had a lot of trouble getting the wireless Android Auto to work well with my LG G8 phone. But, the wired Android Auto basically works instantly when I connect my phone and the digital display with a USB-C cable. As a plus, the digital display has a fast-charging, 3A USB port in addition to the regular port used to connect wired Android Auto.The Android Auto seems to work really well. The audio from the music is very clear, sounds really good and its loudness is ample. Google Maps is very handy and works very well, very similar to how it works on your phone. The Google Assistant is nice when it works, which usually does work for me. I have had an occasional bug where the Google Assistant responses can't be heard. Disconnecting Android Auto and reconnecting, however, seems to fix this. In addition, the Google Assistant voice is a little muffled, but this doesn't bother me that much. I can't really make much use of calling and texting through Android Auto since I have a Google Voice number that I use for texting and calling. There is a Google Voice application on Android Auto, which is nice, however, I can't compose new messages or call people from the Android Auto Google Voice app. I can only reply to messages and answer calls. This is less so a problem with the digital display and more a problem with Android Auto support. I can also customize some of the positions of the widgets and the menu bar from the Android Auto settings page on my phone.My phone is a little older with Android 11 and is no longer receiving updates, so I think that the reason I'm having wireless connection issues is because of my phone and not the digital display. I had a few problems with the wireless Android Auto. First, when I first connected my phone to Bluetooth, even though Android Auto was already installed, I had to manually start Android Auto by going into the phone settings, clicking on ""Connected devices"", and then clicking on ""Android Auto"" which brought me to the Android Auto settings page. Then, I found that the wireless Android Auto would work best when first setting up, by going through the Android Auto settings, pressing ""CONNECT A CAR"", pressing ""Connect using wireless Android Auto"", and then following the steps to connect with Bluetooth from there.Another error I had was when Android Auto would start to connect, but would then show an error on the phone saying ""Communication error 17 - Something went wrong"". This would only happen sometimes, however, and I found that the best way to fix this was to go under Developer options and enable the Bluetooth Gabeldorsche feature stack which is basically the newer version of the Android Bluetooth system used on the latest devices. Another thing that I think helped the connectivity was disabling ""Media audio"" usage for the Bluetooth device. I think when this is enabled, my phone treats the digital display as a wireless speaker, and that inhibits Android Auto from properly recognizing the digital display as an Android Auto device.Again, I think these wireless connection issues were largely due to my older phone and not the digital display.The included backup camera was also easy to install. You do need a tool to strip the ends of the wires to connect to the backup light and one wire going to the digital display. I got the camera working with very little hassle and it is very clear during the daytime. During the night, the camera looks a little hazy, but it still shows you clearly what's behind you.Overall, the digital display works very well and I would highly recommend it to anybody looking to upgrade their car!",https://www.amazon.com/PLZ-Wireless-Bluetooth-Receivers-Subwoofers/product-reviews/B0CFL3MFXF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1

I decided to try the new 8” fire tablet and was quite disappointed.  A lot of the apps I used 9yrs ago had disappeared from App Store and the apps they did have seemed 2nd rate compared to google play store and Apple Store.  I had wished that I had spent my money on a Samsung galaxy tablet (which I have also had in the past which costs around $100).  I do a lot of ancestry and it didn’t have an ancestry.com app….so I use the browser for that.  I have a lot of movies & tv in Vudu app…again, Amazon Fire store doesn’t have Vudu app…so I use the browser.  Fire store also doesn’t have a YouTube app.  So again, I use the browser.  The icing on the cake, which is why it’s a 2 star rating, is the sound is terrible, even all the way up!  My original 2014 7” fire tablet sound was much better as was my old 2014 8” fire tablet sound….i would’ve thought in almost 10yrs that this tablet would’ve improved and not worsened.  I would’ve also thought the App Store for Fire table would’ve improved with more apps also…sad to say, it lost popular apps I used in 2014 such as the ancestry.com app and CamScanner app which I used 10yrs ago on my Fire tablets.  As for the space, this one I recently bought does have 64Gb and I got a SS card to put into it.  I use it alot for reading.  I noticed like my other 2 fire tablets, kindle app takes up slot of internal space and doesn’t transfer to sd card.  I have a few streaming apps downloaded but there’s no setting to have movies downloaded to sd card.  Some apps do download to sd card.  But it seems that the ones I need to ad to sd card don’t for some reason.  Fortunately I can’t do much on fire except use browser…so it doesn’t matter much…yet.  I was really disappointed in this fire tablet.  I wish I would’ve taken the money I spent on this and gotten a Samsung galaxy tablet which is about the same price as I paid for this tablet, but has good sound and a lot better App Store.  When I watch movies or videos in browser on this fire tablet, due to the poor sound on speakers, I have to use my Bluetooth speaker to actually enjoy the shows.  It is a nice and light tablet, especially compared to my 2014 7” fire tablet.  For watching videos on fire tablet, the screen is good.  You also can’t use other browsers on this fire tablet, just the Amazon browser.  So that was also disappointing.  Would I buy this fire tablet again or recommend it?  Probably not.  Even with headphones the sound isn’t good, though as I mentioned, does sound ok if you use a Bluetooth speaker.  If I couldn’t use tablet with its browser to do my ancestry stuff or to read, it would be a one star rating.  The battery life is good and pretty much lasts me hours without having to recharge.  I also found that on occasion, I couldn’t access stuff using the browser on this tablet that I could with my phone.  Which is also a problem if you need it to do for stuff for work.  That’s happened on at least 3 different occasions in the few months I have had this tablet.  That was another reason I had purchased it.  If I had to do it over again, I wouldn’t choose this tablet, I would’ve gotten a Samsung galaxy tablet which is about same price as this tablet.  If I had a few hundred dollars to spend, I would get an iPad, which I have had 2 in the past 10yrs and haven’t regretted those purchases.",https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Official-Site-Fire-HD-8-Pro-Tablet-8-inch-Display-2022-release/product-reviews/B099Z93WD9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1

Quite fast - nothing like the slow chug of the less expensive 7"". Presumably the twice as many core processor with 50% more RAM makes a huge difference. Found mostly all the apps I wanted on admittedly very limited fire app store including all my favorite streaming media. The USB C is terrific for faster charging and to plug in a USB drive or accessory (mouse, keyboard). In fact a Bluetooth mouse works flawlessly -pointer and scroll wheel and click to select. Surprisingly cool difference to  sometimes let a mouse do the clicking. Bluetooth headphones (Beats over ear) also work FLAWLESSLY, great sound, volume adjust and play stop and skip all works. Zero issues. Brightness is fine for indoors and at night can feel too bright so I adjust it down. Obviously not iPhone brightness for outdoor use. Spotify also works flawlessly including with Bluetooth all multitasking while I simultaneously read the news or kindle book. Device does NOT stutter playback even when making that multitasking use. Battery life is beyond amazing too, way more than iPhone or iPad. The built in email software is actually fine to use though basic and simple. Almost forgot - reading on kindle app is a great pleasure and the minor screen dpi density improvement over the 7"" now really does make the text look virtually ""retina"" smooth / sharp (to borrow Apple's screen appearance terminology).

Why did I end up buying the Amazon Fire HD 8 Plus and give it a 5 star rating?This tablet simply exceeded my expectations.I was in the market for a smaller lighter tablet to read books and manga. As good as my other tablets are, they are not easy to hold for multiple hours of reading. Holding a metal and glass tablet with a 10.6 inch screen gets tiring over a few hours.The screen on this Amazon tablet is more than adequate for reading books from the Kindle app. This is near perfect for manga since the screen size is similar to paper manga. Images and text appear nice and clear.Installing the Google Play store was easy. I need apps like Google Home, Keep, Drive, and GBoard. YouTube works just fine.My use case is rather easy to handle. I let my kids test this tablet. If it can keep up with my kids, then it can handle what I need a tablet for.When I handed this off to my kids, they just went overboard on games. They couldn't find all of the games they play in the Amazon shop store, so I'll be referencing some games from the Google Play store.Roblox is a popular app for my kids. The overall performance was good. It really depends on which game they are playing from Roblox. Piggy ran well. Broken Bones was very jittery but playable. Yeet-a-friend plays well if you disable some of the extra options for the game itself. Cookie Swirl C World is playable, but was not the smoothest. Spray Paint played well. Spider also played well. Random OBEEs splayed well.Here is the pattern I noticed with Roblox. If the game supports a large lobby, then there is a greater chance that the game runs a bit slower. I noticed that the large lobby games are running a bit slow, but my kids didn't care. They were still happily playing and winning without issues.Granny Chapter 1 and 2 play well.Gacha Life and Gacha Club ran well.Among Us ran well.They were playing more games, but I couldn't keep up with their long list.Overall, this tablet can run games well enough. It won't be as smooth as a higher end tablet, but I didn't notice any random crashes. My kids would have definitely complained about it. If you are considering this tablet for your kids to play games, you need to consider which games they are playing.Surprisingly TikTok worked well. When swiping through videos, it may take a second to load before it plays. I don't notice that issue on my other tablets. After the initial pause, the videos play well.Since reading and productivity were my main concern, it's a 5 star tablet for the price. Games are just the icing on the cake. Since I don't play them often it would not have been a concern for me.

Apple tablets are overkill and expensive. Over the years I have tried way too many Fire tablets (buying them when they are on sale and with upgrades) and never had one that I was not at least occasionally tempted to throw out the window because it was so slow. With the Fire 8 Plus I seem to have finally found a Fire tablet that I feel is really usable.  Based on me using it mainly for reading, the charging base and wireless charging are not a big deal to me.  I have had some issues with previous tablet (O/S not updating correctly, micro SD slot not working, saying there was no storage space when there was).  Hopefully none of those gremlins pop up with this one.Pros: Battery life is wonderful.  It is lightweight and comfortable to hold.  It is so cheap that if I break or lose it I am not upset.  Tablet is responsive enough and does not lock up.  Sound quality is acceptable.  The textured back does not show fingerprints as much as the flat on other fire tablets.  Did I mention it was cheap?Cons: Amazon App Store is way too limited.  One of my requirements is that it be able to run Scribd/Everand which is not available on the Amazon store.  Fortunately installing the Google store is not. very hard.  The way they have everything revolve the Amazon universe is annoying.  Fortunately, again there are ways to improve/get around that and also allow for more customization.  Screen quality is just OK, but it is sufficient for reading.  Why does Amazon bother shipping with a 9 watt USB 3 adapter?  While it does not charge super fast, with a higher power USB C adapter the charging speed is greatly improved.

But if you're looking for something to serve as an entertainment device to watch videos, scroll through social media or news apps, and play the occasional casual game, then this tablet is close to perfect for the price.I bought mine during the July Prime sales because I wanted something other than my phone for watching videos. I don't mind watching videos on my phone, but I don't want to waste recharging cycles and wear out my phone battery for the sake of indulging in YouTube or binge-watching Only Murders in the Building! I occasionally used my late mother's old Fire from 2018, but I didn't love it; it felt laggy. So I crossed my fingers and bought the HD 8 Plus. I'm very pleased with it. It's much snappier than the old Fire, and I think having the extra RAM really helps. When both the regular and the Plus versions are on sale, the Plus isn't that much more expensive.It's been great for watching videos and doing some other basic internet stuff. I put the play store on just to download a couple of apps that the Amazon app store doesn't have, and that's worked smoothly.As an entertainment device or as a backup to your phone or a more powerful tablet, this is great. You can use most of the basic communication and social media aps and watch videos from all of the major streaming services. It's also not bad for Kindle books, especially ones with illustrations or color photos, though I still prefer my regular Kindle for reading text.The only thing that I really don't like is the feel of the touch screen. It works just fine, but all of my phones and my earlier tablets had gorilla glass, so I guess I'm spoiled by that.In terms of design, I think that the Amazon ""skin"" over the android os is particularly useful for young kids and for less tech-savvy adults who can take advantage of the straightforward presentation of apps and content, especially if your household uses the Amazon ecosystem for other things, such as Ring doorbells, Alexa, Kindle, Prime, etc. That said, there's quite a bit of content ""suggested"" to you by Amazon (advertised), and if you're an impulse buyer, that might not be good!I haven't needed to set up parental controls, but they are there, so parents can customize what their kids can do with the tablet, which is a nice feature.Oh, he my mom's old tablet has found a new role as an ersatz Echo, plugged in in our living room with Alexa on show mode.

You decide if that's good or bad.Having retired I no longer need a computer so it is off and out of the way. Most of my heavy lifting is with a Samsung Tab S7 plus. This was not cheap but by far exceeds my needs. The 10 inch screen is plenty big, but it's a bit heavy for extended use. My needs are now reading a lot and music.I wanted something smaller that I could leave on the patio where I spend much of my time. The weight and size are just about right. The Amazon apps work fine and are speedy enough. Something like NY Times apps is not native to Amazon and is a bit slow. I can live with that.On the patio I have 2 echo studio speakers paired with a subwoofer. By the way, it sounds amazing. The Amazon music app allows for streaming music from the tablet/phone to whatever echo you want. The native speakers in this tab are abysmal, but who cares? Bluetooth or streaming and I knew that going in.I have the charging stand which can allow show mode on the tablet to remind you Amazon has so many things for you to buy. I listen to Arizona Diamondbacks on Sirius/xm and the tablet announces upcoming events or scores. Much easier to navigate Audible books and podcast because sometimes, echo doesn't get it right. Of course when in show mode it will take voice commands as will the paired studios.For basic purposes, this is a fine tablet. I won't be gaming on it because I'm old. But for a great reading and music experience, this does a great job. Yes my phone can do all these things, but the screen is just a little to small. 8 inches is just right. It's lite enough not to cause wrist aches.For internet searches, YouTube etc, I'll save that for other devices. I don't even have email set up on the tab because I'm old and grumpy so no news is good news.I have the Libby app set up on it and it works great. Libby is good for library material. I have the top Amazon music app which plays spacial music. Again studio in pair is a great experience. Forget the native speakers.This gets 4 stars because for what I want, it works just fine. My needs for this are basic. If the NY Times worked better it might get 5 stars. The rating is based upon what this tab is, not what it is not. The Samsung S series is by far better as is the android system, but at a great deal more money like 5 times what I paid for this.Battery life is fine especially with the recharging stand.I can't attest to video latency since it's not used for that.

I was getting a solid 120 mins(just like it said on the screen). I even debated ordering a second one.2 yrs later, it shows 70 mins but it gets about 20 minutes.  Thankfully,  I ran regularly ups battery tests, not through the app but I just cut power to the ups and wait till it's almost dead,  then restore power. This was how I noticed that it shows 70 mins of battery time on the load it sense but in almost... if not less than 20 mins,  it just DIES!Now here's the thing... if you're buying this ups to have enough time to power off your equipment great! But if you're like me and you're buying it to have about 30 mins to an hour of wifi when the lights go out, you'll be fine for a yr or two,  then be ready to buy a replacement.Software: They have a cyber power software called PowerPanel,  you get it for free but if you want to be able to set up the mobile app so you can control your ups on your phone,  then you'll have to pay $11.99 per year for one ups, about $35 for 3 ups' , etc etc.  So why would you want the mobile app?.... so you can get alerts on your phone when things go offline... or when the battery is being discharged,  or the ups is almost out of power.  Although,  you can get around the app by setting up a smtp(mail) and receiving emails instead.Noise: It's pretty quiet when not discharging. However,  when it's discharging.... loud beeping(just like any other ups) and what i think is a fan noise.  I don't mind.  It's alright in the noise sector.Compatibility: you can plug anything into it.  It has a regular us outlet.  Oh by the way,  you cannot plug one ups into another.Recommendation: Personally no. I don't think I'll trust cyberpower ups' again.  The fact that it shows 70 mins expected time and only does 20 is insane to me.  Cannot be trusted.Here's what I'll say though:1. If you're someone who just wants 10 mins so you can power everything off and you know enough to setup the smtp alerts, sure, go for it. But if you're not sure how to set up smtp and you're not willing to learn from a YouTube video or sth... then be prepared for the 12 dollar cost.2. If you want something to actually provide you with battery backup... maybe you're working from home so you want your wifi to last an hour in case of a power outage, DON'T DO IT! DO NOT.... you'll be in for a not so fun surprise.1 star that it was good in the beginning.

I ordered this brand and model based on the Synology compatibility list for my Synology NAS model. I bought 2 because i needed to protect my desktop PC and external USB drive and the same UPS capacity and features work for it. I say 50/50 because I ordered and received 2 CP1000AVRLCD UPS, one worked and is installed as support for my PC and the other was DOA, so right there, in my case that is a 50/50 change of getting a defective unit.After getting both UPS out of the box, I proceded to test one first and then the second, using the same AC outlet. the first one worked fine, but the second didn't power on, the display panel got a little brighter, like a blueish backlight, but it didn't do the beeping sequence and the display showed nothing, which is supposed to do for a little while after being powered on; same result when trying to power it on without being connected to the AC outlet. I then proceded to check the troubleshooting guide in the documentation received and it pointed out to a deleted battery, so I left it connected to the AC outlet overnight. Next day I tried to power it on but the results where the same, so I declared it DOA. However as an additional verification measure, and because I now have one UPS of the same model that works fine, I switched batteries to make sure that it wasn't the battery. The battery of the DOA UPS worked perfectly on the one that works, and the battery of the one that works doesn't change anything on the status of the DOA UPS. In sum the chances of getting a defective one, base on a sample of to units is 50/50. But the one that is working, does it as expected and is real good.Now, I need to comment on support. I first contacted Amazon Tech Support for this product via chat and Joy (that's the name of the lady that pick up my request for support) was very attentive and courteous, asked me a few questions about the steps I had taken from the troubleshooting guide and then proceeded to call me on the phone (NOTE: I live outside the US, in Caracas Venezuela, so it was a long distance call), and she asked a few more questions before patching me through the phone to a Representative of CyberPower (sorry I don't remember the name). He was also very attentive, courteous and willing to help. So, after asking the questions bout model, serial number and troubleshooting steps that I had taken, he agreed that the unit is defective and that CyberPower will replace it.Now, here is where my problem comes. In order to replace it they send a prepaid shipping remittance label so I send the defective unit to them so they can proceed to send the replacement. However, since Cyberpower or Amazon don't deliver this product  to Venezuela) I ordered mine to be sent to my courier service (one way Miami-Caracas) address in Miami, FL and he then delivered it to me. He wont transport it back to his address in the US, an because of regulations in my country, none of the carriers I contacted will. There is a question about it having battery (even if it is not Lithium-Ion). But, in any case, even if there was the possibility to sending it back to the delivery address on the US, to then send it at no additional cost from there to CyberPower, I would have to paid the international shipping  fees from here to Miami, FL of the defective UPS and the international shipping  fees and customs of the replacement from Miami to Caracas, which given the size and weight of the package would amount to the purchase price of the UPS. Hence, I decided not to proceed with the warranty and, as I will in the future even if it looks more expensive, purchased locally an APC of the same capacity and specs (but 10 outlets) which is already installed and protecting my NAS, Router, 2 external USB HDD connected to the NAS and the router, respectively and my DSL Modem.I'm posting 3 pictures: 1 of the one that is good, installed and working, one of the one that is basically a replacement battery (by the side of my desk) and one of the APC that replaced it.In sum, 50/50 chance (again, based on a very limited sample of 2 purchased by me) of a defective one, but with great response from Amazon and CyberPower to replace it via warranty. So, if you live in the US, you shouldn't have any problems getting a replacement  for a defective unit, if you happen to get one.",https://www.amazon.com/CyberPower-CP1500AVRLCD3-Intelligent-System-Outlets/product-reviews/B0BCMLLSHL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1

Which is what prompted the purchase of this new UPS.I was hesitant to go with Cyberpower again because of that previous UPS not holding up, but like I said it was several years old and probably needed to be replaced anyway.  So I upgraded to the CP1500AV and, as far as functionality goes, so far so good.  After I got everything hooked up and charged up, I did a test of pulling the plug of the UPS out of the wall and not only did everything continue running, I even got an on-screen message on my computer saying that it had approximately 74 minutes of battery life remaining, and if the power remained out I should shut down my computer.  Nice.Where this thing really, really falls down though is the layout of the outlets.  The six battery backup outlets are on one side, with the six non-battery outlets on the other.  The top two outlets on each side are laid out vertically, the remaining four horizontally.  I'm not wild about the fact that all the outlets are on the BACK of the UPS (my previous one laid flat and all the outlets were on the top of it and much easier to get at), but I knew from the pictures that that was how it was going to be.What I didn't realize from the pictures is that the outlets are all crammed right up against each other.  Which is fine if all your power cords are the size of a standard three-prong plug.  But a lot of electronic equipment has those big, boxy plugs that take up a lot of space.  Both my router and my network storage drive have those kind of big box plugs.  Because of how close together the outlets are, I ended up only being able to use four of the six battery backup outlets.  The other two are covered by the ""overflow"" of the big boxy plugs.  The old 950VA UPS had the outlets spread further apart so those large plugs weren't as much of a problem.  Whoever decided the outlets should be jammed right up against each other on this model made a very poor decision.Also, the new one is really heavy.  Probably three times as heavy as the 950VA was.  I wouldn't recommend it unless you have a fairly sturdy desk or are sitting it on the floor.",https://www.amazon.com/CyberPower-CP1500AVRLCD3-Intelligent-System-Outlets/product-reviews/B0BCMLLSHL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1

I will update this review with any issues that might crop up though(in the rare chance that there are any issues to report).The LED panel gives a wealth of information about the UPS and condition of the current passing through it. It isn't clear without the manual though that some settings can be changed through the button on the front of the device. Software likely alleviates that issue. I have yet to see a need for software to use it though as this device works perfectly without it. I set my panel to always on. I left its alarm system on as well.(I just looked through my orders and found I had bought another product on this listing. I thought the review didn't look right for this particular product.

Still, was much longer then I expected the battery to last. It wasn't out of charge. Turned off all that hardware when the battery LCD estimated 25% of the batteries charge remained. I know there wasn't much power being drawn from having all that plugged into the UPS. Still it was nice to have access to the internet while a tornado producing storm was raging all around us.Found this brand to be worth buying from. they would be perfect if they updated their battery cable design to something that felt easier and safer to install (like most cables these days. you know. they only can be hooked up one way and it is hard to hook them up in any way that isn't the right one. that sort of update).

I have to admit a little buyer's remorse when the package came in. I debated whether it was really that necessary or just a techie extravagance.My concerns were immediately alleviated when I printed to my laser printer. That printer is a little old and a power sucker. My lights dim whenever I use it, but I thought I had each item on a separate circuit. Apparently not. Immediately the UPS kicked in and modulated the electricity within a safe range for my computer. I have essentially been creating brown-outs whenever I print, putting extra strain on my computer and external hard-drive.The display is nice. It lets you know when the unit is active and turns off when it is not. The blue-lighted power button stays on as long as the unit is on. The size is very compact, but it is heavy as bricks. The setup is super easy. I have it set to my Mac Pro. There aren't many extended options for the Mac. You basically hook it to the compute via a USB cable and set your Energy Saver system preferences for the UPS. That control panel will allow you to determine how the computer responds when it is relying solely on the UPS and gives the battery level of the UPS.Other reviewers are correct in that the plugs are closely spaced, which can reduce the amount of equipment you can plug in depending on the plugs. Only some of the plugs are protected by the battery. The others have only surge protection. But you really just need the computer, monitor, and possibly extra hard drives on battery power. The less power drain on the battery will allow it to last longer.One thing I would be curious to know is whether the UPS computer shutdown will override requests by applications to save files and such. Normally the shut-down command times out if applications hold it up too long. I haven't tested this yet.UPDATE: About a year later and the UPS is still working great. I've been doing extensive electrical work on my house, and it saved me a couple of times when I forgot I left the computer on and shut of the main power.It will beep when the power is off but items are pulling electricity from it. The more electricity you are using from the battery the faster the beeping, which is a very nice attribute.It really helped me out when I had the power completely shut off to my house. Long story but I needed to get a hold of the permit inspector so I could set up a follow-up inspection. His number was on my email, so I hauled the UPS to my living room, hooked up the wireless router and cable modem, and was able to connect to the internet with my laptop.Update: about 2.5 years later and it is still working well.Update: It is about 4.5 years after purchase. The battery has some issues. I do not know if it is because of age or if it is inherent to the product but unnoticed until the situation arose.Issue#1 The power went out while I was walking the dogs. I returned to my computer shut down from power failure. Our walks take about 20minutes, and the power probably did not go out right at the beginning. I am assuming it was out about 10minutes. I would think it should allow for power that long with just one inactive computer and monitor. Most likely the battery is just old now.Issue #2. There was a brown-out. I now have 2 computers plugged in. An old mac pro and a new one. The old one was fine but the new one shut down immediately. The brown-out lasted a few second and the battery kicked in right away. I am wondering if the system let through a power fluctuation that the new mac pro is more sensitive to. This one I would be more concerned about if buying new.",https://www.amazon.com/CyberPower-CP1500AVRLCD3-Intelligent-System-Outlets/product-reviews/B0BCMLLSHL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1

This CyberPower unit has a couple more power sockets then the deceased APC unit, and has a surge suppressor for Ethernet cable, which is more important to me than the 'phone wiring surge suppressor in the old unit. There's also a USB port (and included cable) that lets me connect the UPS to a USB connector on my main computer, and without installing any software a control panel lets me adjust the parameters for computer and/or display sleep under mains power vs. battery power.The front-panel screen is easy to use, although I haven't bothered to make changes to the more advanced features yet.  Apparently I'm drawing so little power from it (although I have at least 18 devices powered by it) that the display shows a power draw of zero watts / zero load and a runtime on battery of 450 minutes.  Clearly that can't be completely accurate, but it's good to know that I've got a reasonable uptime figure on the battery-backed outputs.I chose this model partly because the taller/slimmer form factor is a good fit for where I placed it (where its predecessor was), on the inner floor of a desk cabinet with floor-to-desk height.  There's enough airflow (I added a fan long ago), even with the door to the cabinet mostly closed.  I tend to leave the equipment it's connected to turned on, and most of it goes into low-power mode after a period of inactivity.  Although the UPS's display is set to dim after a while, the UPS isn't really going into sleep mode, which I gather would starve some of my active gear of power and cause abrupt shut-downs for the computing devices, so I'm leaving it that way.  I haven't needed to contact the company's tech support folks, and I hope I never need to.I hope that this unit lasts a good long while, and won't expire when the battery needs to be changed.

Be sure to follow the instructions precisely when it comes to connecting devices to this unit.  Only connect what you really need in the event of a power outage, to the powered outlets.  Computer, modem, monitor, even a small desk lamp/light.  Follow the instructions and DO NOT connect devices like laser printers as they require a large power output to operate, and will create a major drain on this device, even if they're not printing anything. Besides, how often do you have to print documents that you need power to your printer at all times?  I connected my printer and stereo speakers to a separate power strip connected to a different outlet in the room.The software disc that comes with it installs easily, and adds a monitor display screen to your task bar.  This can be opened to show the power available from the unit, should you lose power, as well as, the power drain that would be in effect to the devices you have attached, and your total battery time remaining based on devices that are connected. You can run diagnostic tests to make sure it's fully functional. You can also configure the alarm and software sounds, the length of time your computer runs on battery, and voltage controls for the tolerance of your UPS to voltage flucuations.Simply put, if you have too many devices plugged in and the power drain exceeds the power available, your backup power will drain much faster, and some devices, like your computer, may suffer from a hard crash resulting in lost data that you did not have time to save.You get nine outlets for your devices.  A column of five powered/surge protected outlets on one side, and a column of four surge protection only (non-powered) outlets on the other side. In the center you have phone line in/out ports, coax in/out ports, and a reset button. Above the column of four non-powered/surge protect only outlets is the interface port for connection to one of your computers USB ports. A USB cable, Phone cable and Power Cord for this unit are included. So may sure you have an available USB port on your computer!Directions tell you to plug the unit in by itself to charge it up, before connecting your devices. Lucky for me, mine was already fully charged, so my setup only took a few minutes. I don't know how long it would take to charge it up fully from a depleted state, so don't expect to put it right to use, just out of the box. Afterall who knows how long yours was packaged and sitting on a shelf somewhere before it was shipped to the store, and/or to you.The only drawback I can foresee is that not all power plugs are shaped the same and you may find yourself doing some fancy maneuvering of power plugs on the back of this device, to make sure you connect all that you want to. Large/Wide power plugs attached at the top, or in the center, may block access to the coax and/or phone line ports.

Unknown,R3J9YGGYOBSDDU,Positive,"CyberPower CP1500AVRLCD3 Intelligent LCD UPS System, 1500VA/900W, 12 Outlets, 2 USB Ports, AVR, Mini Tower, Black",4.5,4.0,"6,976","My home and home office contain many sensitive electronic devices.  We have several personal computers, a PC server, NAS drives, routers, switches, printers, cordless phones, security system, etc.  All of these things (and more) plug into the AC mains and are therefore vulnerable to voltage sags or spikes and the occasional power outage.  When a person invests a lot of money in electronic hardware, it only makes sense to do everything you can to protect it.  That is why I always discourage people from plugging these sensitive devices directly into the wall.  I currently have a total of 10 UPS systems and two line conditioners in my home, which protect my most valuable computer, security and A/V equipment.Over the years the cost of power conditioners and Uninterrupted Power Supplies has dropped drastically, and yet the overall reliability and performance of these have improved a great deal.  A typical UPS used to be thought of as a simple battery backup device.  But today the majority of UPS systems also help to condition the power, to a degree, using technologies such as AVR (Automatic Voltage Regulation).  There are several different types of UPS systems available, offering a wide range of output capacities and power conditioning capabilities.  Of course the price goes up as your need of greater output and more sensitive voltage protection increases.  But for some devices you can get by with a modest UPS system, to simply provide a moderate amount of power protection and battery backup time.  This ""modest"" category is where the CyberPower CP850AVRLCD UPS fits in.Model numbers of these UPS systems can be a little confusing, as many people think that the model reflects the output level of the device in watts.  The model number of most UPS systems actually reflects the volt-amp rating, whereas the continuous watt load the unit can handle is usually a fraction of that VA rating, in terms of AC output.  Calculating the exact watt output the UPS can sustain, strictly based on the VA rating, can be a little tricky since the AC load is not usually in precise phase.  However, if you look up the specs of a given UPS system, the manufacturer usually indicates the maximum watts that the device is meant to sustain.  In the case of the CyberPower CP850AVRLCD, the VA rating is 850 but the watt output rating is 510.  That is a 60% difference between the VA and Watt rating.This CyberPower UPS provides Automatic Voltage Regulation, shown by the letters ""AVR"" in the model number.  This means that the UPS is capable of decreasing (Buck) or increasing (Boost) output voltage, slightly, in order to ""clean"" the power it is passing through to your electronic equipment.  This is, or course, while the UPS is receiving AC power through your mains.  If the voltage exceeds the minimum or maximum voltage tolerance, the system will automatically switch over to battery power, in order to protect your electronic equipment.  The included PowerPanel Personal Edition software allows you a modest adjustment to these minimum and maximum voltage tolerance levels.  The software also clearly displays the current status of the UPS, including voltage supplied, voltage condition, remaining battery capacity, battery status, remaining battery runtime and the current battery backed up load on the system.  PowerPanel Personal Edition allows you to adjust the amount of time that your  computer will remain running on battery power before shutting down.  Of course you can choose to set the UPS to allow your computer to run as long as possible, but the UPS will still shut down your computer when it is down to only 5 minutes of remaining time.  Therefore you will need to consider how much of a load your current equipment will put on the UPS, as too much load could cause the UPS to shutdown your computer almost immediately after an AC power failure.  There is also a configuration screen for alert sounds, which allows you to enable or disable the beeping sounds this UPS would normally make during power events.  There is not much more you can do with this software, which really limits its overall usefulness.Some of the most important technical specifications of this device are as follows:*  UPS Topology:  Line-Interactive* Voltage Input:  90Vac - 140Vac* Plug Style:  Right Angle* Cord Length:  6 feet* Output:  850VA / 510 Watts* AVR:  Yes* On Battery Voltage:  120Vac +/- 5%* On Battery Frequency:  60Hz* On Battery Waveform:  Simulated Sine Wave* Battery & Surge Outlets:  5* Surge-Only Outlets:  4* Overload Protection:  Internal Circuitry Limiting/Circuit Breaker* Transfers Time:  4ms* Runtime at Half Load:  7 min* Runtime at Full Load:  1 min* Battery Type:  Sealed Lead Acid - 12V/8.5Ah* Typical Recharge Time:  8 Hours* Surge Suppression:  1,080 Joules* Phone/Ethernet RJ11/RJ45:  1-In, 1-Out (combo plug)* Coax Protection (RG6):  1-In, 1-Out* Computer Interface:  USB x1 - Serial x1* Dimensions (in):  10 1/4"" x 4 3/8"" x 8 7/8""* Weight:  16 lbs.* Product Warranty:  3 Years Limited* Connected Equipment Guarantee:  Lifetime* CEG Amount:  $250,000The majority of my UPS systems are made by APC.  However, I wanted to try a CyberPower unit, so I purchased this smallish 510 Watt unit to provide conditioning and battery backup for a DSL modem, an Ethernet Router, a wireless access point, and a 16-port Gigabit switch.  The total load of this attached hardware is only about 45 to 50 watts, at full working load.  Therefore this UPS should provide battery backup long enough for me to do some moderate Internet browsing from another UPS powered PC or wirelessly from a laptop.  Setup of the CyberPower UPS was completely effortless.  You don't even have to hook up cables to the internal battery, which is something that all APC units require.  Upon powering up the CyberPower UPS I was greeted with a nice blue LCD display, which can be toggled to show current load level, estimated run time, input voltage, output voltage, output frequency, battery capacity, and the current status of the UPS (normal AC, battery in use, AVR in use, if system overload is detected, if audible sound is enabled or disabled, or if there is a household wire fault).  I think this LCD status display is very useful.  However, CyberPower has decided that the consumer does not need the LCD to remain lit, for real-time monitoring.  Therefore you will find that the LCD will shut itself off after about 20 seconds, unless you push the toggle button, which lights it back up again as you switch between status screens.  I find this extremely annoying, as I like to be able to monitor input voltage and current power load by just glancing at the display.  All of my APC UPS systems, with LCD displays, allow me to set the backlight to remain lit at all times.  I just don't understand why CyberPower would not provide this ability.  I don't like it when a manufacturer makes a decision for me that I don't need something, even though I specifically paid for a UPS with an LCD display.  Since I paid for it, I want to see it.  I don't want to have to crawl under the desk to push the doggone toggle button, just to activate the backlight so I can see the display.  The engineer that designed this shortcoming should be fired!Overall I am quite pleased with the CyberPower CP850AVRLCD UPS.  It offers a reasonable amount of useful features, has plenty of backed-up (5) and surge-only (4) outlets, includes Automatic Voltage Regulation, and has a compact footprint.  The battery runtime is rather low, especially when used for a mid-level or high-end PC and monitor.  But for my low wattage needs, this UPS should keep my DSL modem, router, wireless access point and Ethernet switch up and running for quite some time.  The LCD display shows, under the average 45 watt load I have, it will run for approximately 94 minutes.  I almost expect that it will likely last even longer than that.  My biggest complaints with this UPS are the weak software that CyberPower provides, as well as the unchangeable sleep mode that the LCD display goes into.  CyberPower has really dumbed down this otherwise impressive UPS device.  The product itself is a worthy, full-featured UPS system, but CyberPower has restricted user configuration to the point that it just can't compete with other big players in the market, like APC.  For a very basic computer user, this UPS could be a good, low cost solution.  But for advanced users, who demand more control of their UPS settings and features, the CyberPower CP850AVRLCD simply falls short.  I think the folks at CyberPower should consider updating their PowerPanel Personal Edition software, to allow more control of voltage tolerances, automatic computer shut down, LCD backlight mode (choices for sleep mode and always on), and the ability to setup a computer hibernation rather than simply shutting down the computer.  Maybe some of their higher end (more expensive) UPS systems allow for these settings, but I definitely feel that they should consider adding these abilities to models like the CP850AVRLCD as well.  I could easily give this UPS 5 stars if the software was more useful and the LCD display were user controllable, but as it stands now I can only give it 4 stars at best.  Everything else about this UPS is solid and well designed, so I recommend it for basic computer users that do not require power user features and configurability.",https://www.amazon.com/CyberPower-CP1500AVRLCD3-Intelligent-System-Outlets/product-reviews/B0BCMLLSHL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1

This should not be the case, because Amazon informed me this is a NEW PRODUCT. However, it was clear the tape on the LCD screen and the tape on the unit's own box had been removed and replaced at some point, leading me to think someone at Amazon Fulfillment had opened the box.That wouldn't be the first time Amazon has sent me not-quite-new items. I bought a keyboard that had scratches on the INSIDE of it, as well as a motherboard that was missing pieces. You get the idea.That is not, however, a fault of the unit, nor the company CyberPower.-- I will add that I was under the impression batteries were to be stored and shipped in a non-full state. That is NOT the case with CyberPower's units, and the batteries come fully charged, and should be stored fully charged.LOW MULTIMETER READINGS-- Due to believing this UPS unit was not brand new as Amazon had assured me, as well as having read reviews about low voltage output, I decided to put my accurate but 40-year-old multimeter to the test.Now, there is something you have to understand about multimeters, and I'm going to make this as easy to understand as I can, without myself being an expert.WARNING: Anyone who knows the proper terms and complexities of electricity, I am about to make you wince with my explanation!Now, moving on...There are two kinds of multimeter these days, to my knowledge. Average-Responding multimeters, and True-RMS multimeters.An alternating current (henceforth known as AC) typically runs as a wavy line, called a sine wave. It's very symmetrical-looking.But AC, when being interacted with by certain things, say a CyberPower power supply unit, will produce non-sine waves. What that means, is the wavy line suddenly doesn't look as smooth and symmetrical as it does in other places. But it can still carry the same voltage.This confuses your typical Average-Responding multimeter, and it spits out an inaccurate number, one that is typically lower.A True-RMS multimeter can take the numbers from even non-sine waves, which is what this unit produces, and give you an ACCURATE voltage.-- In short: I plugged my 40-year-old multimeter into the unit, it read 91.8v, and I contacted customer support. The tech told me I needed a True-RMS meter. I had NO IDEA what that meant, the tech didn't explain (fair enough), so I ended up having to learn it on my own. Now I know that the unit is fine, and not actually running a low voltage- my multimeter just isn't fancy enough.POWERPANEL SOFTWARE-- Alright, so I'm actually quite fond of this piece of software. I won't go into great detail, but I'll give some examples: the software allows you to monitor how many watts you're using, how long the battery will run should the power go out, and events that have occurred. It also lets you enable or disable the alarms, monitor how much you're spending on what's plugged into the unit based on your local power company's kWh rate, as well as giving you the ability to schedule when the computer should shut down.There's a fair bit more to the software, but that would take a bit too long.",https://www.amazon.com/CyberPower-CP1500AVRLCD3-Intelligent-System-Outlets/product-reviews/B0BCMLLSHL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1

Unknown,R2QDRJPP2PGXVZ,Critical,"Amazon Fire HD 10 Kids Pro tablet (newest model) ages 6-12 | Bright 10.1"" HD screen | Slim case for older kids, ad-free content, parental controls, 13-hr battery, 32 GB, Nebula",4.6,1.0,"3,614","Update: Amazon emailed me asking me to contact tech support.  I did and have updated this review after speaking with them.The basic idea behind the Fire 10 Kids tablet is to let Amazon do all the parenting for you!  Amazon will decide what is age-appropriate, suggest books to your kids, and select what websites they can visit.If you actually want to curate what your children access, here are some things you should know:First, the tablet is tied to Kids+.  When your kids go into Books, they are offered a huge selection of titles that Amazon has deemed age-appropriate.  You cannot curate, filter, or eliminate any of these.  You can only set an age range for your child.  Once you have, Amazon – not you – decides what is appropriate for a child of that age.  The same thing is true with Apps and web browsing.Amazon claims that you can set up web browsing so that your children can visit only white-listed sites you have hand-picked.  This is misleading.  The Amazon help forum is filled with complaints from parents who have turned on this ‘hand picked’ feature and then can’t find the web browser at all.  When you turn on the hand picked website feature, the browser icon disappears.  Instead, your child must now go to an icon labeled ‘On this Device,’ which yields a mostly blank screen telling your child to “Talk to an adult about adding content to this device.” If they then click on the search icon (at the top of this blank screen), they get a set of Amazon icons for ‘Adventure’ and ‘Animals,’ etc.  If you click on one of these, you get redirected back to a whole library of Kids+ content, but now – 4 lines down, so low that you can’t see it unless you scroll – you get a line labeled ‘Added For You’ that includes the websites you have picked for your child.Thinking of adding books that you have selected from your Kindle Library or downloaded from the public library via an app like Libby?  They don’t even appear in the Kids Books app.  That is strictly for Kids+ content.  Where do you find them?  In the same ‘Added For You’ section that is buried 3 layers deep under the On This Device icon.Second, if you unsubscribe for Kids+, you lose much of the tablet’s functionality as a child-friendly device.  You can’t actually cancel Kids+ immediately.  (It comes with the tablet and even if you unsubscribe the day you get it, the initial 1-year subscription continues for another 364 days.) However, you can unlink the tablet from the subscription or create a new child profile that is not linked to Kids+.Unlinking from Kids+ does eliminate all of the Amazon content.  No more Amazon-curated games, books, or videos.  But the related icons and apps disappear too.  No more Books app, no Apps and Games icon.  In fact, without Kids+, the child profile is incredibly clunky.  There are a few basic icons: Music, Camera, Call, Announce, Sound Box, and Screen Time – plus On This Device.  You can add apps and books from your Amazon account, but they all appear via On This Device.  To get to them, you have to go through the same process described above: click on On This Device, get a mostly blank screen, click on the search icon, and then get a series of thumbnails like ‘Adventure’ and ‘Horses and Ponies.’  Only now, if you click on one of those, you get just your downloaded content, without any Amazon offerings.There is no clear reason for this, since if you go to your adult profile, the downloaded apps are right there on the home screen, as independent icons.  It seems like Amazon has deliberately crippled the child profile to push you back into the Kids+ ecosystem.Unlinking from Kids+ also effectively kills many of the parent controls on the dashboard.  Since the new profile is no longer divided into Apps, Books, etc., you cannot manage your child’s time based on activity.  If you want to allow your child 10 minutes of video game time a day, but unlimited reading time, there is no longer a way to implement that effectively.What about reading books in a child profile without Kids+?  There is no Books icon anymore when you eliminate Kids+.  Where do you find the books you have added from your Amazon library?  You guessed it: 3 layers deep under On This Device.  There is no way to sort the On This Device content either, so all your books, apps, and websites are listed in one jumble.  I thought maybe I could partially fix this by adding the Kindle app to the device, so that my child could get to books by clicking on one app.  No luck.  Amazon tech support will tell you that you can get Kindle sharing it to your child’s account via the ‘Add content’ feature in the settings.  But the Amazon-installed apps don’t appear there, only new apps that you have installed.  You can’t actually download the Kindle app to the Fire tablet from the Amazon store (it’s listed as ‘Currently Unavailable’), so there is no way easy way add it.  I pointed this out to tech support and they responded “Ohh not to worry Please download from an unknown source.”  Really.There’s basically just one redeeming feature in a child profile without Kids+.  If you use the 'For You' screen instead of the 'Home Screen,' the downloaded apps to appear on a separate line and your added content 'Added for You' also appears on its own line.  So it's usable - but it's also messy.  The same apps appear on both lines, and your books are still mixed with the apps in Added for You.Third, you can’t turn an adult profile into a kid-safe experience.  The adult profile is the most functional and easily curatable: you can add the apps of your choosing (which appear with icons right on the home screen, just like on a normal mobile device) and you can use Kindle to create a curated library of books.  You could set Prime Video for the Kids profile.  If you are willing to use a workaround to install Google Play (Wired magazine has some good instructions) you could install a parent-friendly browser.  But alas, you can’t remove or disable any of Amazon’s apps.  You still have the Silk browser, which is mostly unrestricted.  You still have Freevee, with its adult-oriented content.  You child could even make purchases via the Shop Amazon app.Bottom line: unless you think Amazon is an awesome parent, this really isn’t a kid-friendly device.  It certainly isn’t a parent-friendly one.",https://www.amazon.com/Amazon_Fire_HD_10_Kids_Pro/product-reviews/B0BL6DCNGR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1
Unknown,R30M6R0ND8R1Y9,Critical,"Amazon Fire HD 10 Kids Pro tablet (newest model) ages 6-12 | Bright 10.1"" HD screen | Slim case for older kids, ad-free content, parental controls, 13-hr battery, 32 GB, Nebula",4.6,1.0,"3,614","We buy a lot of things on Amazon and are generally pleased and don't review much, but with the holiday season close by I wanted to share my experience with this new tablet and hopefully help some others in our position looking to purchase their little ones a new tablet before Christmas. I really wanted to like this tablet, and on first look it appears well built and comes with a nice case for our 4-year-old. I even think it'd be fair to give this tablet 2 or 3 stars on account of that, until Amazon's ""Fire HD Tablet Customer Service"" got involved trying to help. Though very polite, with the language barrier, extremely poor audio quality (very NON-HD), and them simply reading from a monitor to fix any troubles, there was no support to be found and I figure that technical support should factor into a purchase like this.Aside from the initial set-up issues, my biggest two complaints are these:After setting up your child's profile, there is NO WAY TO CUSTOMIZE your child's home screen. Well, of course there is and after a bunch of searching found that it can be done in the parent's profile. But it's an all or nothing approach. You can either let Amazon populate the tablet with whatever they think your X year old would like, or nothing at all. I actually liked some of the curated content but couldn't individually remove the hundreds of other icons to shows or channels that I didn't feel were educational, age appropriate, in another language, etc... Again, it's an all or nothing, on or off toggle. Speaking of which, in the adult's profile there's a slider to adjust the blue light shading. In our kid's profile it's again an on/off - blue light/brown light toggle.Second, and the biggest no-go for us was the video playback quality. Right away we downloaded a couple of our Amazon prime video purchases for offline playback in the car or for an upcoming trip in airplane mode. In our adult profiles the video will play perfectly, clear as a bell. But after sharing and downloading that same content to my son's profile, it plays like garbage. I've spent close to 10 hours with customer service, screen sharing and letting them rummage through the download/playback settings to figure out why it's that way and after being told ""they'll look into it and get back to me"", I haven't heard a thing. On other calls they've simply said to try a factory reboot and a download updates, again. C'mon it's a brand-new tablet. If you have one of these tablets, try this Pepsi challenge. Download a Prime video into your adult profile in the highest quality available, watch it (we like the screen in zoom/full screen mode as most likely would, but it doesn't matter). Then share that video content with your child's profile, download it, and try watching the same video with your child's profile (zoom or no zoom). For us we noticed it on our 1st try with Disney's Planes Fire and Rescue, 25m:25sec mark and watch for about a minute. With all the fast-moving action, you can clearly see how great the video is on the adult's profile and how grainy and burry it is on the child's profile. For our son and his young developing eyes, I do not feel comfortable letting him watch videos in that sort of poor quality. If it gives me a headache, that's enough for me. I guess we could just let him play with the tablet under one of our profiles, but that defeats the purpose of a ""kid's tablet"", and I don't want to be out a thousand bucks for monster truck paint schemes from in app purchases for a tablet that cost $128.99.HD is general term, but blurry and not in 1080p doesn't meet my 2023 definition of it. My first guess is that Amazon may have dumbed down the download, storage, or playback quality for our kid's profiles, thinking that our kids won't know the difference, parents won't notice the difference, and Amazon could save some $ on hard drive space for the price of the tablet. Unless there's a performance setting that I, or customer service while screen sharing couldn't find, this tablet is not for me, and not for our son.I don't want to improperly review this new tablet, so if there's anyone with a keen eye on your kid's videos and solution to either of these problems, please post or let me know.Edit Update 12/12/23: After more attempted fixes with our Fire HD 10 Kids Pro tablet, I've found the visual comparison above isn't really needed. Simply press on a playing video and on the bottom of the screen where the pause buttons/playing time comes up, below that there will be the words ""1080p HD"" letting you know the playback quality. This is the case for the parent's profile while streaming OR playing downloaded content, and the video looks fine. Switching to the child's profile, shared videos will stream fine via Wi-Fi in 1080p (and it will display that), BUT ONCE a video is downloaded for offline playback, there is no ""1080p HD"" displayed below the playing time (whether on Wi-Fi or not) and the video quality is clearly not HD. At least that's how it works on the tablet we got.The morning after posting this review I missed a call from a Seattle area code. Amazon customer service left a nice message wanting to help. They also emailed suggesting that I try downloading the video to an SD card instead of the hard drive. Guess we're doing Beta testing now. Bought a high-quality SD card from Amazon, and as I expected, it did not fix the problem. And just today I finally spoke with a seemingly knowledgeable, very helpful and professional US based technical support agent and learned right away that there's no need to dive into the settings as there wasn't a fix to this and it (at least to me) appears like it could be a known issue. That helps us out and put me at ease that I wasn't missing something. Another new (and possibly updated?) tablet is on its way, but it's been a few days now without any change from ordered to shipped. This was a black Friday purchase for holiday travels, but I'll be sure to change my review if a new working tablet gets here in time.12/20/23 - A replacement tablet arrived (with some finger prints on the screen) today. Surely updated as there's a new and even more confusing look to the kids menus and UI, but same issue. It still can't play videos in the kid's profile in HD quality once they've been downloaded for offline playback.",https://www.amazon.com/Amazon_Fire_HD_10_Kids_Pro/product-reviews/B0BL6DCNGR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1

This was a fantastic feature that allowed parents and relatives to keep in touch while away.We loved it, UNTIL the Dec. 6th, 2023 Alexa app update... then everything communication wise came to a screeching halt.Child's contacts were renamed, mine was replaced and renamed, and a ""dead"" link Home button appeared on the childs contacts with no information, and no way to edit it.the app now only allows you to ""Call All Devices"" when attempting to make a call,?!?Why would I want to do that? Why can't I call just the one I want anymore?  Oh, and btw, it only calls my echo device when it is intermediately working, if you wanna call that working I guess.Additionally, the Alexa app now shows half of my devices are located in several different houses on an unfamiliar street in my community, yet they are all in one house... my house!I've been the phone with Amazon for several hours a day for 3 weeks, and still they have got absolutely no where close to resolving my issue. NOR do I believe they are anywhere close to understanding the full complexity of the issues the update caused thus far.This is because I am stuck in an endless cycle of their internal ticketing system which wreaks of inefficiency and miscommunication.I've been escalated to Amazon's Tech Support Executive Customer Relations, what a joke. After waiting 7 days to get a promised call back that never came, I waited another three days to get a call from the relations team. First off he was clueless, then put me on mute and pretended the call went dead, then never called me back after we were disconnected. It's been 3 more days since, and still no call back! Email responses stating my rep was out ""yesterday"" from two new people in the same department, yet not one took the time to call me.No possible way to get transferred to this department, no phone number given, so wait in limbo again. When I call in and ask for a status update on my ticket, which takes at least 35 minutes to an hour each time, but its the only way to get an update, I am repeatedly having to answer the same questions or try the same ""setup"" settings we know don't work. Worst yet, you wait only for a technician to respond that ""this specific feature"" was not supported. However, talking to an Echo Kid's speaker now is!Wait, what? But it was working tablet to phone and phone to table before the update, so why is it not working now? Why is tablet to tablet communication now not working properly anymore either.Why is it not available anymore? There was no announcement, or choice before the update.Furthermore, if that's the case, why can't any other device in my Alexa app communicate with each other.I now have to purchase a tablet and carry it around all day so I don't miss a call from my nephew's Echo Dot?Why do they keep replying with irrelevancy and misinformation, Has anyone there tried any of this?I've be repeatedly asking to speak directly to an app developer specialist to explain all of things that have gone wrong since the update and have them confirm whether it's the update or simply my account settings.I've been kept from being put in touch with them at every turn, Nope, not possible they say.Finally got a great technician named Diego to take my ""sandbox"" advice and try to replicate and isolate the issue by installing the Alexa app on his phone and try making a calls between his tablet and phone.  To our surprise, he also had issues as described above.He helped escalate my call the app specialists, and even included screenshots. Unfortunately it seems his hands are tied as he has no part in how that information is perceived by the developers and account specialists.I guess those people aren't allowed to use the phones because all of I my notes reportedly say call me with questions so I can explain in detail instead of telling 60 low level reps my issues over and over but only parts of the conversation get entered into the notes, but nobody ever does.You'll never fix an issue you don't fully understand, Amazon.I'm so feed up, as far as I'm concerned, they can keep this junk... and the cruddy service that comes with it.Read Amazon's lame reply...Hello,I'm Hugo of Amazon's Tech Support Executive Customer Relations Team.We could verify that the option to complete calls to Amazon Alexa devices on a phone using the alexa app has been removed.Fire Tablet for kids only supports Alexa to Alexa calling after it is enabled from parents dashboard.Alexa to Alexa and Alexa to phone calling both are supported only on Kids Echo Dot device after enabling from parents dashboard.Thanks for sharing your thoughts about the Alexa app. We're always looking for ways to offer a better shopping experience, and I've made sure our Alexa team sees your feedback so they can consider it in their future plans.If you need any additional support, you can reach out by replying directly to this email.Have a nice day.Best regards,Hugo Quesada NavasAmazon.com",https://www.amazon.com/Amazon_Fire_HD_10_Kids_Pro/product-reviews/B0BL6DCNGR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1

I have 2 of them. And, so far, the 10 is awful. I like the content I get from Amazon Kids + for my boys, but the whole point of a tablet is for it to be mobile and keep content. This tablet has (on multiple occasions) lost access to all content and corrupted my SD cards.Now, I do like the 2years warranty that it comes with. I like the kids case for shock proof and a stand.But, I still find it hard to look at my child and say ""all that work you did on your games is gone again"".  I've even had to tell my kid on 2 separate vacations that ALL the movies we downloaded from Prime Video were gone. So, the plane flight and the long drives were extra long because all the content was gone and the tablet became a giant brick.These tablets have the ability to accept an SD card and use it for internal storage (its written on the page) but, that card is only good for 1 tablet and can not be moved to a new one without reformating. And when these devices corrupt the card, it is unusable anywhere (including computers and I'm a computer nerd). I've had Amazon support replace it once, but the last person wouldn't. Saying it wasn't an issue with the tablet. Coincidently, I've had to replace the tablet and its corrupted my SD card on 2 separate tablets. For the additional $50 you might get an older iPad that has the same memory or more than whats built in AND it wont slow down with games. Yes, thats right, this Tablet is known to slow down with games. It even says it will. Yay. The additional cost to replace SD cards each time, can easily add up to not using this tablet.How is tech support? Eh, its like calling a Comcast agent. Is the tablet on? Did you reboot? Can you factory reset the thing and start all over?

Unfortunately, I have to say that the previous model Fire tablet was much better at media consumption. The speakers of this latest model (Gen 13) are noticeably more quiet than those of the previous model (Gen 11). Additionally, colors seem to be slightly more vibrant on the older model as well. The older model tablet is slightly more heavy, but not enough to impede its use by anyone.That being said,  people in the reviews still seem to be expecting this product to be an iPad for a third of the price. While the Fire 10 HD Kids Pro isn’t an iPad, it’s an acceptable amount of tablet to be had as cheap as $100. I just wish the Fire 10 HD Kids Pro (Gen 13) could do as good of a job of playing audio and video as the previous Gen 11 model.The Amazon parental controls for this tablet do take some getting used to, but they do a decent job in delivering age-appropriate entertainment once set up. It’s not foolproof, as one can find ways to bypass filters if they really try. Android apps can also be sideloaded onto the tablet if desired, but I haven’t found a great way to get them to run outside the parent/unrestricted profiles.I still would recommend the Fire 10 HD Kids Pro (Gen 13) tablets to parents of older children, however its use as a portable media player for adults has suffered in the model update. For owners of the previous Fire 10 HD Kids Pro (Gen 11) model, I cannot recommend this new model as an upgrade. While this newest model has faster response times due to the updated hardware, the ability to enjoy streaming audio/video content has suffered with the less powerful speakers and display changes.",https://www.amazon.com/Amazon_Fire_HD_10_Kids_Pro/product-reviews/B0BL6DCNGR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1

He's special needs so he didn't understand why he couldn't watch his movie correctly or play games that couldn't download, so I gave him back his old device, because a least that one doesn't buffer, no did it have issues downloading games and apps.

Check your Amazon kids subscription (you get 1 year free, then you have to renew.)2. Go into parental controls. Make sure you have not limited screen time (or set time limits), or turned on learning first. Just check all those boxes off, and fix the limits/restrictions after they get their apps/games back.They should reappear checking those 2 things.--------- Review ---------My child has had a fire tablet since he was 4. I have upgraded to the newest kids tablet every year for his birthday. This is the newest one for him. He's loved playing Minecraft, Roblox, some apps that come pre installed on the tablet, and he also likes browsing the store.- The kids fire tablet is easy for kids to use and pick up on.- I can set restrictions like he has to read or learn first, and what times he can use it to limit screen time.- The coolest thing is I can do it all from my phone. From approving games, education, and screen time.The memory on the device is decent for a kid but you can always upgrade it with a micro SD card. He has Minecraft, Roblox, messenger for kids, YouTube/YouTube kids, and some other games/apps. I had to approve.Sound: whew this thing is loud for what it is.  I'd recommend some headphones so you don't have to hear it loll.Overall the appearance nice, it's a good value for your money (I know it's a high price tag compared to other brands) but the amount of peace it brings to a parent is worth it.

Overall, I rate this tablet four stars due to its impressive performance and kid-friendly design, with a few minor drawbacks.Bright and Clear Display:The 10.1"" HD screen is bright and clear, making it perfect for watching videos, playing games, and reading books. The vivid colors and sharp resolution enhance the viewing experience, ensuring that kids stay engaged and entertained.Kid-Friendly Content:The tablet comes preloaded with a vast selection of age-appropriate content, including educational apps, games, videos, and books. The Amazon Kids+ subscription offers a wealth of material that is both fun and educational, catering to a wide range of interests and learning levels.Robust Parental Controls:One of the standout features is the robust parental controls, which allow parents to set screen time limits, filter content, and monitor usage. This ensures a safe and controlled environment for kids to explore and learn.Durable Design:The tablet's durable design includes a sturdy case that helps protect it from drops and bumps, which is ideal for young users. The case also features a built-in stand, making it easy for kids to watch videos hands-free.Performance:The Fire HD 10 Kids Pro performs well, with a responsive interface and smooth operation. It handles various apps and games with ease, providing a seamless user experience for kids.Battery Life:The battery life is decent, lasting long enough for extended use throughout the day. It charges relatively quickly, minimizing downtime between uses.Minor Drawbacks:Despite its many strengths, there are a few minor drawbacks. The tablet's storage capacity can fill up quickly, especially with the addition of apps, videos, and books. An external SD card can help alleviate this issue, but it is an additional expense. Additionally, while the tablet is generally responsive, there are occasional slowdowns when running multiple applications simultaneously.Conclusion:The Amazon Fire HD 10 Kids Pro tablet (2023) is a fantastic device for children aged 6-12, offering a bright and engaging HD screen, a wealth of kid-friendly content, and strong parental controls.

When I first bought the product, I found the price tag of $150 quite high, but I expected it to deliver premium features, especially transcription functionality.The device itself is impressive in terms of quality and performance. However, I was disappointed to discover that transcription services are limited and require a paid subscription. For someone like me, who is in constant meetings throughout the day, the limited number of transcriptions included wouldn't even get me through a full day, let alone two. Given the high price of the device, I feel the basic transcription service should be included for free, especially since this is a core function of the product.I understand the need for a subscription to access advanced AI features, such as highlighting key points, organizing notes, and improving the overall quality of the transcription. However, basic transcription—without the advanced AI—should be a free feature, especially at this price point.In summary, while the device itself is excellent, the limitations on transcription and the additional cost for a subscription significantly reduce its value.

Note that I pay for the Pro Plan for more transcription minutes ($79/yr, or $7/mo if you subscribe for the annual rate - otherwise $13 if you opt to pay monthly).Pros- Discreet and thin- Useful all-in-one for meeting transcript +  summary meeting recaps - love it, super easy and reasonably good audio (not as clear as an iphone Voice app recording, but works perfectly for my purposes)- Responsive customer support- Transcription accuracy is reasonably good (enough for my purposes)- As you review the transcription in the app, you can tap on a specific section to play audio - I use this to manually correct the transcrip, or check who was speaking- Easy to export audio, transcripts,  summaries, and mind mapsDrawbacks- Audio quality isn’t super crisp but perfect for my purposes (NOTE that I haven’t tried the RAW audio file option which could make all the difference from a quality perspective, I just haven’t tried it)- The transfer speed is super slow, even on WiFi (~ 26-30kb/second, whereas I read that a normal transfer speed should be at least 100+ kb/sec). Very annoying when I want to quickly open or title a file I just recorded.- Because it takes so long to transfer recordings and you can’t create a file name until it’s fully transferred, I end up with a lot of unlabeled recordings that download all at once (have to listen to each one to remember what it was). It would be great if the device at least immediately synced the existence of a recording so it could be labeled in the moment even if not fully transferred.Tips:- I don’t know what the white light means, but it’s only recording if the light is red.- Check out YouTube videos for super easy set up and demo- Remember to check the app to see what the battery level is.- If you lose the bespoke charging cord, you can buy another on Amazon.",https://www.amazon.com/PLAUD-Transcribe-Summarize-Empowered-Languages/product-reviews/B0CZX48H2Z/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1

I had a 2-hour video conference meeting with people in China. They were speaking English and then talking to each other and Chinese and the meeting lasted almost two full hours with the large gaps of silence. I recorded the whole thing and to my surprise everything that was recorded in Chinese was translated to english. And when I saw how it broke the notes down into the different sections of the meeting the questions that were asked marked who was who and put it all together. I see use this for this thing for anybody in any field that they need to remember anything, want to look professional with meeting notes, need to go to a doctor and have a bad memory, want to just keep a record of things, the list is endless. If you need a better reason just buy it try it out for a couple weeks, I have a hard time believing that you'll return it.You used to be able to use an app to record your conversations on your phone. It's getting harder and harder to find an app that will allow you to do that. But what's even nicer than an app is something that attaches to the back of your phone that doesn't stick out and just requires the top of a button to start. You don't have to open an app that doesn't have to be anything running on your screen and it doesn't have to be obvious. You can be in the middle of a phone call or before the phone call starts you can begin recording or if you're in a meeting you can begin recording anytime you like as well. The best part about this product is that it dictates everything and also summarizes it and breaks it down for you. So if you go to the doctor let's be honest it's hard for everybody to remember what the doctor tells you it's easy just to record your conversation it'll break down what did you talk about what are the answers what are your medications and that way you can go back and look at it. The same applies to a phone call if you're talking to somebody and they start giving you detailed information and you don't have a pen and paper handy you just tell them to hold on or even easier just tap the record button real quick and let him keep talking it'll record it all dictated and then you'll have detailed notes. I can't say enough good things about this product. I'm happy with my free trial, I'm not really looking forward to spending $10 a month to keep the dictation, but I am using it enough to make it worth the money. I do wish that for$150 that you got a Year's worth of dictation for free. Also the Aftercare support with the home company is good. I accidentally placed the metal ring on my case slightly off and I contacted them and they allowed me to get three new metal rings as well as two additional chargers for five cents plus shipping. The shipping was obviously the most expensive part. But it's nice to be able to get replacement parts and not be hassled about it.",https://www.amazon.com/PLAUD-Transcribe-Summarize-Empowered-Languages/product-reviews/B0CZX48H2Z/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1

They seemed affordable and had a lot of great reviews. Either I received a dud, or these are deceptive.CASEI don't like the case. It's bulky and doesn't really fit in my pockets. It's an odd shape to hold. Rather than a notch to open, this case has a lip. The magnets holding it closed are quite strong - I've had other wireless headphones and what sets this case apart is that between the awkward shape, the odd lip, and the strength of the magnets, I have to grip a bit harder and push a bit harder than I expect to in order to open the case. I'm sure I'd get used to it if I used them more often, but, on the first use, I thought the case was accidently glued shut. if you have any sort of hand mobility/grip strength issues, I would not recommend these.Note: The headphones claim to be IPX8 rated, but the case does not. They also don't recommend submerging in water, whereas Tozo (on their website, not on Amazon) claim their IPX8 rated products can not only be submerged in water, they can also be cleaned with soap! That includes the case. If you're intending to buy headphones to use near a pool, lake, or ocean I do not recommend these.FITAfter I found the tips that fit best, I had the sensation that they were falling out of my ears, though with a nice seal they seemed secure - I tried shaking my head and they were still in my ears - they felt like they were constantly sliding out. With the really thin tips, it felt like it wasn't secure. Even when I rotated them, they were a bit large for my ear and stuck out a bit - I would not recommend for smaller ears.SOUNDThey sound ok. If you want better sound, I'd recommend wired headphones as better sound can be had for about the same amount. As-is they're fine for listening to music, podcasts, etc on the go. I have some wired earbuds that I use for passive noise-cancelling on planes. I otherwise prefer to be aware of my surroundings. Even with a seal, these have no sound isolation whatsoever. Even quiet noises could be heard. Additionally, if I had a seal and walked around in them, they sounded a bit weird, though I think that's just a noise caused by physically blocking my ear canals and not necessarily the headphones themselves.BUG?A single tap on the outer part (button) is supposed to play/pause the music. I tapped once to pause, then once to play. Instead of playing, the earbud I tapped beeped (as seems to happen when tapping/touching the button - I believe it is a noise to let you know your tap/touch registered), then the earbud I didn't tap beeped twice. The music did not resume. I tried again and it worked. That's the sort of bug I experienced 10 or so years ago. There have been so many improvements in technology, I'm surprised this happened within hours of receiving them after they had been charged.THOUGHTSUnless I received duds, I can't see these being good for too many people. Even if you're on a budget, Kurdene's own S9 (which is currently (02/24/2023) available for about $9 if you check the box for 50% off) resolves most of my issues. The case is a more standard size, thin enough to fit in a pocket, opens much easier, buds are smaller and don't need to go far into the ear canal. Sound is a bit better in my opinion. It even has LED indicators to show you how charged the case is. A huge improvement across the board, available for less, from the same company. Yet, when I started looking at new earbuds, the S8s were advertised on every single listing and search. They were pushed hard. With over 60k reviews, the overwhelming majority of people impressed by them, I thought I'd give them a try. Even at under $15, I don't think they're worth keeping as spares and I intend to return.",https://www.amazon.com/kurdene-Bluetooth-Light-Weight-Headphones-Earphones/product-reviews/B0D635YLCT/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1

I listen to them mostly on walks, and sometimes in bed. I am ok with there being little noise cancelling, because I still need to be aware of my surroundings. I can still multi task. With both headphones in, it does pretty well at not letting outside noise through. They’re very comfortable. I find that most wireless ear buds don’t stay in my ears, these do!!

Only when something is really good or really bad.  This product was the latter.  It started off ok...nice looking frame.  Very quick set-up.  We purchased as a holiday gift for my mother (65 y/o and somewhat tech savy) who lives a plane ride away so we could surprise her with pictures of our family now and then.  We really liked the email option.  Our kids set-up the custom email address and it was somewhat inappropriate, so I reached out to customer service to see how to delete it and set-up another.  It took a day or so, but they got back to me and reset the frame.  I thought this was inconvenient that we couldn't do it ourselves especially since all the uploaded photos on the old address were now removed, but wasn't that concerned at first.We started to upload photos to the new address and noticed that the mail icon and timer appeared in the upper right hand corner.  It didn't go away for over two weeks that we had the product.  Meaning that it was trying to download and couldn't.  The photos also lagged in spots and I received messages that ""ourskylight is not responding"".  Also the menu button on the back was not responding at all.  Clearly something was wrong.  I turned the frame on/off, reset my wifi router, placed the frame by the router, etc, etc.  Everything the website said on their troubleshooting section.  I even deleted every photo assuming we sent too many than the storage could handle.  No luck.  I have a home office so it's not like I had issues on my end with WiFi.  There was no actual customer service number to contact, which is the norm these days and fine, but email customer service did't get back to me for almost a week.  I wanted this all set-up for a gift and needed time to return, receive new and set-up in time for Christmas.  Thank goodness Amazon stepped in immediately and sent me a shipping label and full refund (even though this was a 3rd party vendor).As I wasn't going to make the same mistake twice, I started to do some more research on similar products.  There are much better and more economical frames out there.  Getting down to the basics:1.  There aren't a whole lot of ""customized"" options on here.  The settings button is kind of a joke and only lets you select a wifi address or tell you ""how it works"" email address.  No other real settings.  You can select a different speed (in seconds) but I noticed it reset from my 5 seconds per frame to 10 seconds.  Perhaps part of the original defect.  Another review called this a ""One Trick Pony"" and boy were they right.2.  To delete photos, you have to go to each and do it one at a time.  Select...delete.  Select...delete.  Kind of archaic.3.  Other frames have motion sensor on/off.  Nice as this frame requires a hard wired outlet and you would need to manually turn off if this was, say, next to your nightstand and you didn't want the frame on when you slept.4.  The touchscreen is worse than the first version of whatever touchscreen device rolled out.  Slow, pressure sensitivity was terrible, etc.  Again archaic.5.  Does not play video.  Many of them don't and the ones that do are more expensive.  But just saying don't buy if you want to play video.In short, this was one of the more expensive frames out there.  The lack of features, seemingly ""old fashioned"" tech and poor customer service makes this a hard pass for me.  That is on top of the fact that mine came defective.  I'll say they did finally get back to me on how to return for a refund, but too late for me.I'm hoping I have better results with NixPlay.",https://www.amazon.com/Skylight-Frame-Digital-Picture-Anywhere/product-reviews/B01N7ENHO6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1

This is one of the most popular and that must be due to marketing because quality wise it is not the best.  Features wise it is okay, but some of those features are locked behind a paywall.What is good about this frame is that it is easy to send pictures, you can  use it in portrait and landscape and it has pretty easy to use touchscreen controls.  Overall it looks good and is easy to setup and use.However, the build quality is pretty low. Clearly this frame is lit from one edge.  That becomes apparent in landscape mode when many of the pictures have a lighter band down the right hand side and ghosting is visible when the picture changes. Also, it clearly hasn't been color calibrated as the colors come off as cool, or yellowish depending on the frame.  And picture storage? This frame only has 8gig of ram.  Ram is cheap enough this should have been minimum 64gig.  8 gigs does not hold a lot of photos.Additionally, the screen only allows 1200x800.  Nobodies camera takes photos that low quality and so when you send pictures the system compresses and crops your photos.  So you end up with some very fuzzy pics, and peoples heads cut off.Finally, many of the features are behind a paywall.  Want to add a second frame to the same email?  Paywall.  Want to make albums?  Paywall... you get the idea. If you can get it on sale and significantly cheaper than it's competition then it is okay, otherwise grab one of the competitors for better quality and no paywalls.",https://www.amazon.com/Skylight-Frame-Digital-Picture-Anywhere/product-reviews/B01N7ENHO6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1

The model number on the back is SKYV3. The color of the plastic on the back is black.I in turn wished to purchase this exact item (model SKYV3 digital frame) for my parents. However, when the item arrived, it had a white plastic back, a much longer and completely differently designed stand (like a pencil that screws in, rather than a flat magnetic stand like the SKYV3). I then noticed that the model number is different. It is SKY002, an older version, I presume.  Some have commented that the item number listed (916496), is for the newer model SKYV3, but what arrived for me (ordering the item number 916496) was model SKY002, which others have stated they got from Amazon, when they too believed they were purchasing and would be receiving the SKYV3.What I want is to get the SKYV3, but I fear doing a simple Amazon return/exchange will merely get me another SKY002.I originally bought a Frameo digital frame for my parents.

This SKYLIGHT frame is more expensive, and only allows these features with a yearly $39 SKYLIGHT PLUS subscription!

However, it’s only available for $101+ from an Amazon seller (way overpriced).  Look around and you can find it for $50 at other stores.I didn’t want to wait as we have bad weather in our area now and I wanted to be prepared ASAP.  This radio arrived the next day for $35.* What I like:Small size; very compact and it feels solid & durable (also IPX3 waterproof). The buttons to select options/change channels feel very nice and have a satisfying click.  The reading light and flashlight work well.  Very nice carrying strap.  Digital tuner makes it easy to select stations. Loud SOS alarm.  The unit came fully charged and ready to use. The ability to power the device from standard batteries (3 AAA’s), hand crank, or AC adapter.  It has a solar panel but the manual notes it’s not intended to fully charge the unit but to “keep it operational” (my interpretation of the instructions).Speaker quality isn’t too bad for such a small unit.  It’s not amazing, but it will do fine for news and weather alerts.  The unit will use its rechargable battery for power first, then use AAA batteries if they are installed.  This is a great feature and extends the runtime of the device. Radio also has a clock so you can check the time at a glance while using the radio.  Headphone jack to listen to audio privately; ability to charge a device via USB.  A plastic cover for the charge/power ports, to protect from dust/dirt. And I like the green colored case!  I didn’t want bright orange so this is very nice. LCD screen backlight so you could use the device easily in the dark.* What I don’t like:Solar panel isn’t as usable for charging as I would like.  I have not tested it but the manual specifically states the panel is not intended to fully charge the unit.  There is no ability to save radio stations to memory/presets.. would be very useful.  Now I just keep a piece of paper near the unit with radio stations written down, so I know which to tune to for news/etc.  The radio antenna is quite short, so some stations won’t come in as clearly (but it works OK).While the fabric strap feels nice and provides a good way to carry the unit, the strap gets in the way of the flip-up reading light.  One can move the strap out of the way but it does feel like this could have been designed better.* To be determined:I have no idea yet if NOAA Weather alerts work. If there’s a weather alert the radio is supposed to sound an alarm and flash a light, so you know to turn the radio on to listen to the weather alert.  I haven’t received any alerts yet, but have only had this about 6 hours.When the device is set to receive weather alerts (by default it is set to do this), when the radio is on standby (powered off) a red LED on the side of the radio flashes once every 7 seconds.  This is a nice way to confirm the setting, but until I receive an alert I won’t know if that works or not.  (And it’s one of the reasons why I bought it!)* SummaryA nice, compact unit that seems to work well based on what I have been able to test so far.  Once I receive a weather alert I’ll know for certain this works as expected; will update review if possible when that happens.  Until I can verify the device fully functions I’m rating it 3/5 stars.Provided the weather alerts work, I think this is a good unit for $35.  The Midland is $15 more but may be worth the cost, if you don’t want to take a chance on a company you have never heard of before.",https://www.amazon.com/Emergency-Raynic-Cellphone-Headphone-Flashlight/product-reviews/B08T1FB7J3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1

Unknown,R354TFG3F50IZH,Critical,"Raynic Emergency Radio, 5000mAh/18500mWh Weather Radio, Solar Hand Crank Radio with AM/FM/SW/NOAA Alert, Cell Phone Charger, Headphone Jack, Flashlight and SOS Siren",4.5,3.0,"15,089","First off, for this price one would expect a decent amount of attention paid to the radio band functionality, but for intensive purposes, it appears as though the radio bands were the least important area of design in this particular model.I liked the flashlight and top flip-up lantern and the siren function is pretty loud, which one would expect it to be, now for the big let-down, the Am has virtually no selectivity as the lower range of frequencies are jammed together, for example 600, 640 and 690 khz are virtually right on top of each other, (maybe a hair-thin distance) and to tune to them requires turning the tuning dial very slowly around ""520"" on the dial!  Now further up the dial, the stations are spaced a little more but still I have a QFX radio that cost less than 1/3rd the cost of this model and it has the same, (but better engineered)  DSP base circuitry and yet aside from having to manually readjust the tuning pointer, the QFX has sensitivity and selectivity on AM ,something this model does not even come close to accomplishing.  FM is slightly better in the dial inaccuracy, (it's off by 2-3 Mhz on most stations)  I tried out SW both during the day and at night, (when it's easier to pick up most stations and I did this test outside to eliminate house wiring interference) and turning the tuning dial as slowly as possible, I could  not pick up any discernible signals, I could not even pick up the time standard signals either and I tried to anticipate the dial inaccuracies when tuning as well, and ""no Joy"".  The only band that worked was the NOAA and only if I extended the whip fully did I pick up a clear signal.So, if all you need is a crank lantern/flashlight/siren and a NOAA radio, this is probably a bit overpriced but it does do those things adequately, but for me that's not why I bought it, I bought it for the bands that on this model do not perform as expected and I would advise anyone interested in this series of radios, (different colors) to keep looking.Although I don't care for this model and I'm returning mine, at the very least, this radio does not have the dreaded sticky rubber coating that eventually makes handling the ""Red Cross "" series such an annoying PITA.I can recommend some other radios that perform basic AM/FM/SW quite well for around the same price as this model and in some cases, significantly less, (these are all DSP based radios).QFX - R-24 - Runs on 3 ""D"" cells and goes really loud as soon as you turn it on.  (only drawback is the need to open it up and move the dial pointer to match the dial position as both samples I've bought have this issue) I usually move the dial into place once I've tuned to a lower band station, then move the dial pointer to the correct frequency on the dial ""cord"" as it's not well glued, so it's easy to slide up or down the cord into an approx position.Kaito KA-29An excellent AM/FM/SW digital radio with direct frequency entry and a smooth movement tuning knob on the right hand side, although it only tunes in 5 khz increments on SW, it is still easier to tune to a frequncy quickly without having to spin the tuning knob, it will only allow increments of 5 khz on SW, (so no numbers between 0 and 5 allowed, it will always tune to the nearest 5khz increment to what is entered.Even though the TIVDIO  V-116 is similar to the Kaito KA-29, it has fewer accessible functions and the selectivity on AM is almost as bad as the crank radio being reviewed here, FM is ok and it's forte is playing MP3's as no matter what time of day I try it, the V-116 does not appear to be designed to actually pick up any SW signals, so if you're torn between the KA-29 or the V-116, avoid the V-116 if you want a functional SW pocket receiver that can pick up a lot of signals without an added wire , get the Kaito KA-29 or if you're in for a Chinese challenge, the Degen DE-29 is the same model with Chinese buttons.",https://www.amazon.com/Emergency-Raynic-Cellphone-Headphone-Flashlight/product-reviews/B08T1FB7J3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1

But otherwise it was almost identical, including side button placement, LED lights, and solar panel. This one has digital tuning and does have auto-scan and can also auto-wake on weather alerts. And this one is styled to look at lot like the Kaito A6000L, although it much smaller and has FAR fewer features (but is also a lot cheaper).What I like: It's got an internal battery that can be charged via USB, hand-crank, or included solar panel. It also takes 3x AA batteries for power. It picks up AM, FW, shortwave, and weather bands, as well as weather alerts. It's got a flashlight and lamp/reading light function. It has a headphone jack. It can serve as a charger for low-voltage digital devices. It remembers the last band and station you were tuned to when powered off. The antenna is fully articulating.What I don't like: The internal battery is not designed to be user replaced. There's a door on the bottom right where the internal battery is, but it just opens up to a plastic shield under the battery and you can't get to it without taking the whole radio apart. AM and SW reception is abysmal. The volume and tuning buttons are clacky-clacky sounding and loud. And my #1 dislike is that there is an ""SOS"" loud alarm function that is turned on by a button on the side of the radio and it is VERY easy to accidentally turn this on and annoy everyone within 100 feet of you or wake up sleeping camp-mates.",https://www.amazon.com/Emergency-Raynic-Cellphone-Headphone-Flashlight/product-reviews/B08T1FB7J3/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1

This little device is very handy to have around especially when you live in an are that gets storms often.  I just ordered mine and have been testing it out.Solar Panel:I won't give 4 stars on the charging via solar panel due to the fact they make it very clear that it's a backup method for charging as it's slow to charge because the panel is small.  It does work and will get you through in a clinch.Lights:The light on the end is very bright and has a nice dimmer for times when you don't need the full brightness.  The top light is handy for adding a nice amount of light to a dark room rather than just being a direct light.  I'm happy with the lights they work nicely and the brightness is great.Radio:I found the radio to be clear and the volume good as well.  I was able to find a station that gives good info on my area, which is important when hurricane season comes around.Alarm:The alarm is loud but it's not going to deafen you if you need to use it close to you in an emergency when you may want to be found or easily located.Charging:With the power cord it charges pretty quickly, USB also charges it pretty quickly if you have a battery pack charger.

I forgot to bring it in.  Last night we had a severe thunderstorm with rains heavy enough the streets were flooded with 2-3 inches of water.  After the storm I realized the radio had been sitting out fully exposed to the storm.  It still works after letting it sit inside overnight.I have the analog dial version, so tuning is cumbersome but the station quality is comparable to other radios.  Audio is decent for this type of radio, Not great but it works well enough.  I wish it had a better solar panel for faster charging, and a larger LiIon battery.

It is nice the LiIon battery is easily replaceable.Interestingly I just took the LiIon battery out, no AAA batteries installed, and in the sunlight the flashlight still worked just on solar power.  Not sure how useful that is though!  The radio and SOS alert did not work.  I put the battery in my charger (Nitecore UMS4) and it indicates the battery is still in ""Good"" condition, however I was disappointed it only had ~1900mA of charge after sitting outside in sunny conditions for 3-4 days.

I bought this specifically for the hand crank feature, NOAA & the built-in 5000 mAh battery power bank to guarantee a working radio/alerts/flashlight when all other charging options are unavailable or have failed. While the digital version was appealing, a LCD display does use power and will eventually fail which kinda’ defeats the purpose. I also wanted something that was lightweight and portable for me to carry vs the old worldstar “portable” unit my boyfriend insists on lugging around. It wasn’t until recently that we got to compare the two units and this had much better radio reception and we could actually pick up more active bands and NOAA weather channels during a ‘real tropical disturbance’ (Debbie) than his portable! It appears this little radio not only picks up weather alerts and SW bands, but it also picks up a wider range of local radio stations available on our other home units. The sound quality is better than what you’d expect for this size radio. Actually, it’s quite impressive. The audio comes in clear and decent on the internal speaker & on headphones when using the jack (with or without the telescopic antenna extended). I’ve tested pretty much all the functions and have accidentally set off the SOS alarm (it definitely works by the way & so does the red flasher!). Everything works great. Even the flash light & reading lamp puts out good illumination and with the strapped on NSEW compass you might be able to get your bearings. It’s still a hard call of how efficient the unit will be when tested under a live situation, but hopefully it won’t come to that. It charges reasonably quickly for USB and AC, with solar being the more timely followed by hand cranking. With a 5000 mAh battery I should be able to rely on this as a decent backup should my Anker die. Anyway, as the saying goes, ‘it’s better to have and not need, than to need and not have’. I’m happy to ‘have’ the Solar Crank CR1009 as part of my emergency kit to keep me informed during emergencies. It’s takes up little space and weighs under 15 oz, making it extremely portable to carry in your over nighter, sling bag, sport bag, backpack, etc. when hiking, camping, glamping etc. You can also attach or hang it with the carabiner provided. The only feature not included was making it waterproof and that’s easily solved with a ziplock gallon bag.Overall, this is exactly what I was looking for. It’s plain, simple, compact, reliable, well built, and at a good price point. It’s your life line to staying safe and informed during unexpected weather events whether it be blizzard, wildfire, flash floods, earthquake, hurricane, electrical storms, etc.  This is totally worth every penny and 5 Stars!

They never work for streaming music because of a woeful update to its software. Even the NYT, which once recommended the system as the best has changed its mind. About three months ago Sonos updated its system software that literally rendered my entire Sonos speaker system (This Sonos Era 100 included) useless. To use this system as a music streaming device, you must use the Sonos App. Sonos used to have one of the best apps in the business. Intuitive with amazing functionality. A few months ago they tried to update it, basically trying to make it look more like Amazon music. It was an utter failure. Folks like me are wanting to sell their entire system. I stayed with sonos for three months now since they promised they would make things right. They have not. The speakers stop streaming music after playing just one song. Nearly no commands work correctly. When I tell it to stop playing a song. It does not listen. I manually have to press the button on the speaker. This system was developed so you could talk to it and play all music across an entire CD. That used to be possible. Now it is not. Literally stops playing after one song. Via voice prompt, when you tell it to go to the next song, it cannot. We Sonos music streamers have lost the capability to stream music directly from our device's own music library. Many of us bought Sonos because we wanted to have great speakers that would directly play music from our phones or our shared music library folders on our computers. That functionality has ceased to exist. Run! Don't walk. And return these speakers. Their only use today is as a bluetooth device where you have to physically press each song you want to move onto via whatever controlling system you have for bluetooth. The Sonos incompetence here I cannot overstate. A once great company and music system has fallen. Such a shame. It did not have to be this way.  If I could speak to the CEO of Sonos I would tell him this:  Your bread and butter was your speaker system, not headphones, not other products. Get back to the basics. Restore the streaming functionality that allowed us to enjoy music via touchless voice commands and software that was once top notch. I have five Sonos speakers for sale. I hate to do it, but I am making all my speakers Amazon speakers.

It has plenty of connections on the backside for you to add a lot of components and includes eArc so you can connect it to your AV system as a one and done.I found myself connecting to the ears and moving on. I have an Apple TV.  Because of my quadriplegia, in rough Best Buy in to mount the TV and help me run cables.For the speakers:I chose the Sonos Arc, Sub Gen 3, and torches ERA 100’s as my rear speakers.  Since everything is wireless and Bluetooth I was pretty excited.I am a developer in real life and though this would be pretty straight forward.  I added the sound Bar first to my TV and wireless.  Right off I noticed the sound bar would not discover the 5G network.  After some reading, it only communicates on standard wireless networks.  And you have to use your iPhone or Apple device on that same network.  Ok, don’t panic, let’s keep going.I then made sure the TV could interface the sound bar.  So far so good.Now let’s add the two rear speakers and sub.  These were able to see the 5G network but not the standard wireless.  So now I have 3 speakers on bedroom 1 and 1 speaker on bedroom.  The directions tell you can merge these.I purchased a new Logitech Harmony 915 remote with hub.  The Samsung remote is useless.The speakers use the Sonos app to connect to each other and allow you some other fine control. The app is horrible.  I’m constantly fighting to keep the speakers connected to each other, and when you have to reconnect the bar to the other speakers you totally loose sound and have to use the remote to bring the sound back.  At the same time the sound control coming from your iPhone app could be at a level that is blowing you away.For the Sonos speakers I’m in at a cost of around $1600, the fact that an app can make it feel like a total waste or at least the price point is over by $1000, I’d say don’t waste your money until Sonos fixes the app.  All the speakers should be on the same network.  I’m learning how to use the Logitec remote to control the speakers, but since Sonos is using an app.Overall, it’s not a bad purchase but I feel like each company tried build in technology that leaves the user in a fight.  I’d recommend you do more research.  I would have returned all this but I had an unexpected hospital stay that put my return time past the allowed window by 4 days.I’ll learn it, if I just can’t make it work, I’ll sell it.  Maybe I’ll get lucky and Sonos will step in and help.I hope this detail helps someone.",https://www.amazon.com/Sonos-Era-100-Wireless-Speaker/product-reviews/B0BW34LCB8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1

Unknown,R3K58ELV5GGS7W,Positive,"Sonos Era 100 - Black - Wireless, Alexa Enabled Smart Speaker",4,5.0,864,"I already have 2 Era 100's and a Sub mini in my Family room. They sound fantastic.  Some times I like to sit in my Living room and read, or meditate. But I would turn the volume up in the family room so I could hear those speakers. So I decided to get a third  Era 100 for my living room. I put it on a small decorative shelf.  I must say it is everything I imagined it would be. When setting it up I didn't know I could turn off selected speakers. This was a unexpected plus for me. So if I am in my living room I could just have the one Era 100 speaker play and vice versa. Or I could have all three and the sub mini playing at the same time. After having the 2 Era 100's and Sub mini for a couple of months now, I had forgotten how good just 1 Era 100 speaker sound. I did notice the two Era 100's paired with the sub sound more clear and crisp than the single Era 100's. That's because the Sub mini is using the low that the Era 100's would had normally played. Great concept in sound and speakers.  I just turned the treble up a little bit more in the single Era 100 to get more highs. Sounds good. It's too bad Sonos doesn't allow for multiple Sub minis connected in the same group, it would be phenomenal. I had read somewhere that it wasn't cost effective for the consumer to buy 2 Sub minis when 1 Gen 3 Sub woofer has more output than two Sub minis. I say who cares Sonos? If a consumer wants to spend their money on a second Sub mini and put in in another room in the same speaker group it's their prerogative. If that's true then their business model doesn't make since to me. Set up was a breeze too. Because I didn't use a tutorial to set this up, it took me a few minutes to figure out how to select the speaker, because at first the single Era 100 didn't play although it was connected.  But the setup was a breeze. Very easy. I may get another Era 100 (this time used) and put it in my kitchen and I'll have sound throughout all of downstairs. I've been fortunate to not have problems with the app, unlike many others.

So keep that in mind when reading my comments. This fit, finish, and execution of this product is excellent. The app and setup process was completely troublefree and I had the pair of these configured and playing in stereo in about 10 minutes. I really appreciate the tactile control on the top of the speakers for pause, play and volume up and down.The sound quality was a mixed bag for me. The top end is very even and without any stridency. There is a modest amount of mid range suckout. This was somewhat disappointing for me as I listen to a lot of female jazz singers. Vocal reproduction is often missing the natural timbre that you get from higher end speakers and headphones. Vocalist can sound ""thin"" and somewhat nasley. And then there is the bass.Once these speakers are placed properly (8-10 feet apart) and the listener is positioned to create a triangle from the speakers, the bass is somewhat shockingly good for speakers of this size. I had to turn the loudness feature off and dialed the bass down (-2) in the EQ setting. The response from the bass with these settings is still stong and punchy, and there is even a bit of texture to the sound. How Sonos is able to accomplish this with a speaker these size, I just don't understand.The convenience of the stereo pair and overall performance of the speakers make these a keeper for me despite being an audiophile.

Unknown,R3IMVCH6NGTZRB,Positive,JBL Tune 510BT: Wireless On-Ear Headphones with Purebass Sound - Black,4.5,4.0,"66,368","I got these yesterday, on sale for $28 or so. I wanted something to use while doing work/chores/phone calls. I’ve been using Bluetooth Skullcandy in ear headphones, but they annoy my ears after wearing a long time, or daily. Also, no one can tell you have headphones in, so I wanted something OBVIOUS. People tend to leave you alone then!! :)Summary at bottom if you don’t want to read my words!First out of the box, I charged 5 minutes and tried them. Initially, I was impressed, bass was good, sound was pretty clear. I listen to a lot of metal, and I’m very particular in what I am able to hear. All around it seemed pretty good! Could be better in some areas, but again I’m trying to keep in mind they were 30 bucks.CONSAfter wearing for the rest of the day to test it out, some things came up. The louder you turn it up, the more flat or muddy/messy the sound gets. Bass in general seems to wash out a bit? I want to hear my drums, man! And one does not *quietly* listen to metal music. Not possible!It will NOT cover the noise of weedwacker/mower, but I wasn’t fully expecting them too. I’d say it cut half the sound out. Also it seems to pick up sound? My in ears have a “stay aware”option, where it plays the ambient noise while wearing. While this isn’t equipped with that, it sure seems to let certain noises through loudly. It’s odd. Like my dog barking, I can hear that almost clear as day. Might just be me?PROSPhone calls? Perfect. I can hear other person clearly, they can hear me clearly. Have no issues with that area at all.Super comfy, no ear discomfort at all.Battery kicks assLight weightButtons are nice, not too close together to fat finger the wrong one.So I’m mixed, I know it’s a lower end headset but was hoping to keep true sound, and bass, the louder it got. Love the phone calls and comfort, battery is great. If you’re looking for a starter, or for kids, these are great!

Now we have 3 chords traveling down a wall to a surge protector. Looks so good doesn't it? Not at all!Put this little guy right behind the TV, all cables follow 1 line right to this. 1 braided style cord goes down to your socket. Now we are looking organized.

Unknown,R2M5NP47KK4Y5K,Critical,"Dragon Touch 10.1'' WIFI Digital Picture Frame - 1280*800 HD IPS Touch Screen Digital Photo Frame Display, Auto-Rotate, Share Photos/Videos Instantly via Free App Best Gifts for Birthday, Wedding, Mom",4.5,1.0,"10,374","I bought two of these frames for $129 each, and ended up with two expensive paper weights and hours of frustration.I'll start off with my specific use case for these frames, because maybe I'm expecting too much. All I wanted was the ability to randomly display family photos. I have a lot of them (like 2,000), so I kept them stored on a USB disk. The plan was to plug in the USB disk to the frame and have it randomly select the photos from the disk.That plan didn't work, because the frame would periodically stop reading the disk. Sometimes after unplugging the disk and plugging it back it I would recognize the drive again, but eventually it stopped reading the drive altogether. To the company's credit, they did respond to my customer service email request and suggested a factory reset. Multiple factory resets solved the continued problems for a while, but eventually that stopped working too and the frame quit recognizing USB drives entirely. I tried different drives with only a few photos on them, and that didn't work either. Finally the company sent me a replacement frame, which solved the problem...for about 3 months. Then the new frame had the same problem. Wash, rinse, repeat with the factory resets.Eventually I was advised to stop trying the USB route and instead load all the photos directly onto the frame. Apparently it didn't have enough memory to hold all of my photos, nor is the software smart enough to prevent someone from trying to load too many, because when I tried to transfer them over the new frame seized up and never booted up again. At that point the company sent me yet another frame. This time I loaded the files I wanted individually (which took hours of effort) and things seemed to settle down for a while.Then the random screen saver problems started. Apparently the frame has a screen saver function that cannot be adjusted in the menus and it randomly starts coming on. I should add that the screen saver turns on after less than 1 minute of operation, where the frame just goes dark. You have to push the power button to get the frame to come back to life, but it just goes dark a minute later. Once it starts doing this, the only option is a factory reset where you then have to reload all of your photos from scratch. No thanks, the frame goes in the trash at this point.So what else do I hate about this frame beyond the fact it stops working all the time, can't read USB drives, and has a screen saver that basically precludes it displaying photos? Well, the wifi receiver range is terrible. I measured both frames at about 5 feet from my router before they couldn't detect the signal, so if you plan to email photos to your frame, it had better be located right next to your router.Also, the random photo feature is far from random - as I mentioned above, I have a few thousand photos and typically see the same 100 or so each day when I turn it on. Of course, once the screen saver problem starts up again, I see maybe 5 pictures in a day before I just turn the stupid thing off.Finally, I can't stand that the frame has to be connected to wifi in order to factory reset it. I have a frame in my office at work, and our workplace IT policy wouldn't permit this device from being connected to our work wifi (with very good cause I'm certain). So each time it craters, I have to drag it back home, get it connected to my home wifi, reset it, and then spend hours loading all the pictures back on the frame to get about 3 months of use before the stupid screen saver problem randomly starts up again.I should note that the company did try to help me on multiple occasions after I wrote a previous poor review. They sent me two new frames, but as I mentioned above, both of them also failed. Finally they asked me to send back one of the frames that had completely seized up (couldn't power it on), at which point I agreed to delete my old review because they had been so helpful. I never heard from them again once the review was deleted, and never got the frame I sent back replaced. Frankly I don't care, it's more trouble than it's worth to try to set up another one just to have it fail.In conclusion, this frame is terrible and it has stolen many hours of my life for which I paid $260 (for two frames) for the privilege. Hopefully this review will help someone out there avoid the same fate. Pick a different brand of frame...any frame but this one. I can't imagine you could do worse with another brand.",https://www.amazon.com/Dragon-Touch-Digital-Picture-Frame/product-reviews/B0CYZLWG1S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1

The Dragontouch 15 seemed like the right frame but it isn’t.  The screen size is big but the software is not smart enough to display both horizontal and vertical pictures properly in full screen mode (the way every PC or Smart TV does)  Additionally downloading photos to it results in really poor resolution, USB stick gives the best image.After spending several hours trying a multitude of options here is what I learned.1. The frame plays .HEIC files, from iPhone (good) but vertical pictures ALWAYS show horizontally reguardless of how rotated on the PC (bad).2. File format must be in .JPG if you want to show vertical files vertical on the frame. It takes time to cover every vertical photo JPG. :(3. If full screen mode is selected.Horizontal Photos - the full screen space is taken up horizontally with a horizontal photo in HEIC or JPG format, as expected.Vertical photos - HEIC vertical photos show horizontally and take up the full horizontal screen, not desired unless you like to tilt your head all the time. A vertical JPG photo will be cropped top and bottom as the photo is zoomed in by the frame until the width of the photo is full frame.4. Full Screen NOT selected. This is the only setting to get a vertical photo displayed vertically without cropping and zooming  An unused, blurred area is on both left & right sides if any picture. The larger 15” frame size is effectively reduced and a smaller picture rendered.Horizontal photos - photo is smaller in HEIC and JPG with blurred bars right and left.Vertical - JPG photo will show full height with blurred areas right and left. This is Theo not way to show a vertical picture vertically but at the expense of smaller horizontal photos.With a bit more effort in writing the software I’m sure this issue could be addressed as it is on smart TVs and PCs,  but nope, didn’t happen. Yes, I’m running the latest version of software 1.1.43. After figuring this out, sadly my return period is expired.If all your photos are exclusively vertical or horizontal, this frame is for you. If you have a mix of vertical/horizontal like 99.9% of people, look elsewhere if getting a full screen image on a more expensive large screen device is important to you.DragonTouch developers - open to solutions to fix this issue. Please fix this issue and send out an updated software push!Finally, the screen surface is plastic and not glass, so go easy on it when cleaning to prevent scratching. While it is a touch screen, using the remote is quicker and eliminates the need to clean the screen and potential to scratch it.",https://www.amazon.com/Dragon-Touch-Digital-Picture-Frame/product-reviews/B0CYZLWG1S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1

I really wanted to love this since I read all of the reviews on similar products and thought this one would be easiest to use. I bought this for my parents who are in their 90's. I set it up per the instructions and sent the registration info to all of the relatives. Worked great, as many of them were sending photos and once they were accepted on the frame, their pictures started showing up in the slide show. I was a happy camper!  Gave the frame to my parents for Christmas and thought - ""I'm done"". They'll get updated pictures and can keep up with the family. Well, I was wrong. I went over for New Year's and saw that the frame was display a white screen. It had happened a couple of days after I had set it on their table and they didn't know what to do. It was unresponsive, so I power cycled it. It started working again - Good news.  I asked them to call me if it happened again. It did, power cycled, and froze again. Emailed the mfg, they said they would replace it, which they did. Great! I think. Got the new one in week - great customer service. Find out I have to register this frame - no way to transfer the data, so had to get all of the relatives to register their emails again.  Happy to get the replacement working.  Update May - the replacement freezes with a black screen now, not white. Still have to power cycle to get it to work. It lasts for a day or two and freezes again.  The re-registration process was such a pain to get the relatives to resend all of the pictures, that I've decided not to replace it. - Oh and btw, I did check the settings to make sure it isn't set to go to sleep or anything like that. In fact it froze within 5 minutes of being power cycled one time. It's random and you don't know how long it will last before freezing. I'm really frustrated with the product, but it's the only one I found that didn't require me to have a subscription and came with enough storage to hold a lot of pictures.",https://www.amazon.com/Dragon-Touch-Digital-Picture-Frame/product-reviews/B0CYZLWG1S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1

Just changing the orientation in a picture viewer won't really change anything, Windows or your phone will simply ""remember it"" in the cache, but won't actually modify the picture itself. Windows Paint on the other side, will rotate the picture itself, that was the final solution for me with this Frame, and probably many others frames out there.Now I'm finally enjoying the frame properly, it gives you the option to turn off the screen at specific periods of time which saves some energy.1st review:This is a good digital frame in the sense that it does what it is expected, display pictures one by one, and use some effects for the transitions.The main problem it has is that it won't rotate the pictures correctly, some pictures will be displayed upside down, while pictures that are taken vertically with your phone are displayed horizontally.Some people may think this is expected, but pictures actually have metadata in them to help applications display the picture correctly, with the correct orientation, so that if it has to be rotated 90 or 180 degrees, the application will do it.All my pictures look perfect in the computer using any picture application, because all these applications know how to use the metadata, but the frame does not. They do have a manual rotation button, but as soon the frame us turned off, the settings are all reset and the pictures are all displayed with the wrong orientation again.I've been waiting for a firmware update for a long time, years, but the issue is still there (Jan 2023).",https://www.amazon.com/Dragon-Touch-Digital-Picture-Frame/product-reviews/B0CYZLWG1S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1

If you're like me, you the perfect digital picture frame will:> Allow you to be set this thing up and walk away from it, confident it will work without further intervention.> Make it easy for family members to contribute photos to the frame.The achilles heel of this frame is that it struggles on these points.  For one, there's a little-advertised limit to the amount of data that you can transmit to the frame.  I'm not talking about the internal storage space on the device, that's obviously limited.  I'm talking about using the 'OurPhoto' App to send pictures.  Purchasing the frame gives you 10 Gb of complimentary 'traffic data'. That means after sending 10Gb worth of information to the frame, you're going to have to pony up at least $10 for an additional 10Gb.  10Gb is realistically about 2,000 photos of sufficient quality to actually enjoy looking at on the frame.  If you have maybe a few family members contributing to the frame you will hit your limit and you will need to buy more storage.  Kind of a bummer.  Wish I had known.  Now you do.On the second point, one feature that made me want to go with this frame was the ability to set up a unique email address for the frame and simply send photos to that email address.  That way you don't need a stupid app on your phone (by the way, the OurPhoto app is not well designed), you and your parents' boomer friends can just fire off emails and the pictures will show up.  But in my two weeks of setting up and fiddling with this frame, I've only gotten one email to actually make it all the way to the frame.  I called tech support on this and they walked me through their script (of course the call center you get isn't actually the company that made the device, it's an outsourced call center who can do little more than read you the troubleshooting pages from the manual).  None of their tricks worked.  Why? Likely (I'm making a guess here) because Dragon Touch is having network/server issues in China and for reasons I can't control that feature is just not working now (12/7/2020).  Maybe a rush of holiday purchases have overloaded their capacity.  Probably they'll get this straightened out some day down the road but for now that method is not working and I can't do a thing about it (except write this honest review and contemplate a return).If you don't care about getting bilked for more money to send photos to YOUR frame, and you trust that they'll fix the email issues eventually, this frame isn't terrible.  It's got a decent enough screen and I like the frame and mat board appearance instead of the tablet-on-a-kickstand appearance of other photo frames.  The frame feels plasticky and cheaper than it costs, though.  Also a remote would be nice so you don't smudge up the glass all the time.",https://www.amazon.com/Dragon-Touch-Digital-Picture-Frame/product-reviews/B0CYZLWG1S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1

It allows the app user to pair with the frame, but to be able to use the email feature on the frame, you need to manually input the sender's email onto the frame itself.  This is only an annoyance if you plan on giving this frame to someone who doe not understand technology.The second frame I bought (from this same seller) used an app called OurPhoto.  This app has you send a connection request to the frame and connect a unique email to the frame at the same time.  You need to approve of the user connection on the frame itself to be able to send photos through the app or the created email.Both need the user to either add the email or approve the app user in the frame itself.  The main annoyance is now having to use two different apps, so if you're buying multiple frames for different people, keep that in mind.Otherwise both frames provided the functionality specified.Update to my review.The frame that uses the OurPhoto app is disappointing.  You still need to use the app to register a new email address for people to add photos with.  I couldn't get the email address function working.  The reason I wanted the email address function was for family member to add photos that are not tech savvy.

There are lots of things I really like about this device. First, it has a touch screen, which make it far easier to use than my previous one that just had a few buttons. Second it connects to Wifi (2.4GHz which is 802.11b/g, so no issue for me). This means I don't have to keep moving a USB drive or SDcard back and forth. You can also email photos to the frame, which would allow you to send photos to a remote relative with the device.It was very easy to add the device to my Wifi network. I was pretty excited about the fact that it came with an app. I don't like reading manuals, but I wasn't able to get the app working without reading the manual. The instructions are pretty clear in the manual- you have to look in the settings to find the device ID, but the screen seemed to be showing me a device ID in explaining what to do, so I used that a few times unsuccessfully. It would have been better if this screen didn't show me an ID.There are several things which prevent me from giving this 5 stars:First, using the app to upload photos counts against a 10GB quota. Once you use that, you have to buy more data at $10/10GB. (Looking at my latest photo, this does mean I could upload about 3000 photos before I hit my data limit, but I'm sure videos would eat that up quickly). Since my app is on the same Wifi as the frame, I'd prefer it to interact directly with the frame. This means that I might end up using the FTP interface, which feels pretty ancient for 2021 (and the manual says it only works for Windows, but I can't understand why that would be true, but I have a Windows machine so I didn't test others). I was able to upload a photo using FTP easily.Second, it can only handle SDcards up to 32GB.Third, I have to use the touch screen to delete photos. I can't delete them using the app, or the FTP interface.Overall, it is a nice device and we really like having a slideshow of family photos being displayed.",https://www.amazon.com/Dragon-Touch-Digital-Picture-Frame/product-reviews/B0CYZLWG1S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1

There are good and poor ""features"" as well as inconsistencies between the two.TLDR: For the price and fact that there is no subscription fee to use remotely, they are a decent purchase. I would buy them again.The long of it:The good:Great little design, quiet motor, reasonable coverage, good signal and response.The Poor:One of the two cameras tends to have a meltdown if used for too long and will disconnect from wifi. At this point you have to be there in person to reset via unplugging the unit and plugging it back in. I've tried firmware updates and resetting the unit back to factory settings to no avail. It doesn't overheat as often on low resolution, so I keep it on the 360p until notified and I want to see the scene, when I raise the rate to full 1080 (and reduce back down when I leave). I also keep it close to the router, for now this seems to have stopped the disconnect issue. I'm weary to leave it on for long periods of time unattended.Even when the camera is shut down (privacy mode) the unit is still cranking out data and heating up. This usage should be minimized, just enough to keep a connection and receive signal to turn back on.There is no volume setting for the speaker on the unit itself, I've found from my iphone, speaking softly from the phone at 18 inches away the camera blasts my voice and scares off my kitten. Seems to be no point in having a speaker on the unit at all. This applies to both units I purchased. Seeking resolution it looks like Kasa updated the firmware in 2021 to raise the volume of the speaker for galaxy users who had the opposite problem.

It’s pretty fuzzy regardless of where I place them, despite having strong WiFi connection. If that was all, then I could live with it. But the control of them is terrible.

When it works, that is.I haven't had a second to purchase an SD card, so perhaps the experience will improve once I get that far. As for now, I turn it on before I leave in the morning and turn it off when I get home (the constant notifications drive me crazy with the puppy running around in front of it and I'm not quite sure i want to see a 👻 when I'm in bed lol). But I've found, it glitches A LOT. I have a 20 minute commute and by the time I get to work, it's already cut off. I'm often having to turn it back on. It's rare that I can get the live feed.

The monthly subscription plan was impossible to find. At one point I got an message in the kasa app about how I can be notified by email when my kasa is turned off daily, but despite it being a good idea I waited, and when I couldn't find the option, kasa customer service in taiwan denied any and all involvement with such a message or feature.On 6-16, a month in, the kasa camera developed an over 60 second delay between the cell phone video shown and the actual direction the camera was pointed. In the same day, my blink mini read 'backup failed for 'MTWTrF'.Almost every time, when arriving home, turning off the kasa camera that had detected my motion and that was pointed at me correctly, took minutes. The app is slow, and the off button takes more than a few presses for camera to turn off. In actually checking the feed, to see if there was any recorded motion while away, the camera often took another minute to load that specific window.The app sort of makes sense, and for $29, and no monthly cost for the camera to operate, its ok. But getting the video off it is harder, while the monthly subscription is hard to find.In signing up for the subscription, $3 is missing from my account monthly, but there isn't a registered transaction that I can find. This implies I have to work with their tech support or replace the initial pan tilt.///More than a year later, the kasa pan tilt still works, but I worry of increases in small problems from a better review. What stands out is the app, and related gadgets. The app itself looks really smart, from scheduled on and off patterns. The kasa pan tilt goes well with kasa light strips, and there are a ton of scheduled features possible that integrate the camera with lights.But, despite the app being quite smart, and well integrated with other devices that similarly work, the pan tilt app could use a lot more smart features in the app. There could be a more complex schedule, so that the pan tilt could turn on at approximately 9 am, and switch to a different area of the room every 10 minutes, with changes in camera direction happening at controllable increments.As it is, its possible to schedule turn on the camera, so it reacts to and tracks motion, and put it in a patrol mode, but its not possible to auto schedule a shifting array. Its not possible to tune the camera so it tracks and follow motion between 9 am and 5 pm, but turn off the track and follow feature once I am likely to get in. Nor it it possible to schedule the camera to patrol the room once an hour, to save the motor.",https://www.amazon.com/Kasa-Smart-Home-Security-Camera/product-reviews/B08GHX9G5L/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1

The motion detection and noise/sound detection works very well, if baby wakes up and is moving around or crying I get a notification within seconds.

Even if you do get inserted, or do not have a case, this little power bank's weight is still too heavy to only be supported by the USB C male part.

At a minimum I highly recommend that if you are using it, to do so only if the power bank itself is supported in someway.I have decided to keep this power bank though, and use it only with the included (short) USB C to USB C cord.Also keep in mind this power bank is only 5,000 mAh and will only fully charge a phone's battery if the phones battery capacity is less than this.  The power bank itself  charges up fine, and  quickly charges any phone that has a battery of less than 5,000 mAh, so I am please with this.

However, after trying with multiple devices and multiple wattages of input, and reaching out to customer service to return and replace my first power bank in case it was faulty, I have still no luck with this feature. This was the main reason I purchased the power bank, and I'm really disappointed that even my replacement product does not work as advertised, especially considering how much longer I had to wait for the replacement to ship and leaving me power bank-less for a week, since the older Anker power banks are almost rendered inert by the new iPhones because next to no one owns a USB type A to USB type C cable. Will likely be returning if customer service does not respond with a solution.10/30 Update:After a few weeks of correspondence with Anker support, involving two replacements and patience, Anker support was able to offer me a one time exception of a full refund without return for the inconvenience. I still think Anker has great products, and their customer support is also quite solid, although there were moments they were unreasonable (asking me to try a different color as if that had an effect of the pass through charging capabilities).Regardless, the real reason I found behind the pass through charging issue was the fact that the new iPhone pro line is capable of charging other devices like your Airpods, so when plugged into this power bank which is also being charged, the power bank think's it's receiving two inputs and turns off completely to prevent any overheating issues. It would've have been nice to have received this disclaimer in the product description, but hopefully Apple can release an update that allows their phones to recognize when power banks are attempting to charge and receive charge simultaneously.",https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Foldable-Connector-Portable-Charger/product-reviews/B0C6XK77HJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1

You don't want to risk damaging the folding hinge.My biggest pain point with using this portable charger is in with the spacing of the hinge relative to the rest of the body. The USB-C connector on the body stick out from the rounded body of the charger, making it prone to damaging things perhaps in a purse, and presents an unnecessary risk to the connector.There is also the issue of using the device on a flat surface. Its no ones fault when phones and their cases come in all shapes and sizes, and is something i never considered until using a power bank with a built-in usb. When in use, you may find that the device does not sit flush on either side of the hinge. Or when you prop your phone on its side using a stand to watch a video, the bank may be too large, giving you an unwanted tilt, or in worse cases is thinner than your device and hangs freely placing stress on the charging port of your device and the connector of the bank. I started to bring in dish cloth and folding it up to prop my phone while charging. Even a small amount of height and padding does wonders to alleviate all my issues with charging on a flat surface.All in all, having this power bank has made me keenly more aware of product designs and how they would interact with my own devices. I routinely use this everyday for work using the built in port. Going 4 months of almost daily use and have had no issues with the device. 11/10 for being one of the only portable charges of this profile with a hinge, massive props to the anker product development team.",https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Foldable-Connector-Portable-Charger/product-reviews/B0C6XK77HJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1

With my iphone 15 pro (regular) at 10%, after 30 mins, it was at 51%, after an hour it was at 75% and when the last dot on the anker stopped blinking, my iphone was at 92% after about ~1.5 hours. So, this 3.5 oz device roughly doubles the battery life of a 15 pro with no cables.Since the 15 pro's battery life is abysmal, I am hoping this solves my travel problem and won't have to get the new 16 pro max, saving me $1300.Conclusion: It does fast charge at roughly 22W as anker advertises (Apple says 0-50% in 30 mins for iphone 15 pro at 27W wall charger) and I'd say the overall actual transmitted capacity is around 2800 to 3000mah after the heat loss.

Every time it boots up it generates a random MAC (Media Access Control) address for its WiFi interface. If you have secured your home network so that the only devices you allow to connect to your Wifi is on a white list of MAC addresses then every time you turn this off and boot it back up again it will warn you it is being blocked because the new random MAC address does not match the one you allowed last time it was running.This also prevents you giving it a reserved IP address.Frameo (which is the app or mini OS running on top of Android) does not have access to change to a static MAC address according to their support because it was a built in setting at the time of compiling the Android OS. I should also mention that they are not necessarily the manufacturer of any particular frame using their software, which is why they can't control it.Unless you are planning on setting it up on a public WiFi in a coffee shop this makes it an unusable pain in the you know where.So, if you have an unsecured WiFi at home then you may love it and not even notice the problem but if you do care about security and have a MAC white list then you should avoid avoid avoid.On an additional note the Frameo app will try and get you to subscribe to use more features.

Where this one goes wrong is the additional power cable which doesn't exist on the smaller one. The power cable inputs to the side of the device making any mounting instantly more difficult and ugly.

Their products just seem to work for me and last long enough. I tried four HDMI splitters from three different brands—two cheap ones didn’t work at all. I figured I needed to spend more, so I bought a model that sort of worked. However, the power adapter for it didn’t work at all, so I had to use my own. Since the picture quality was good and it was easy to use, I decided to upgrade to a higher-end model because I needed one more HDMI slot.Unfortunately, that one didn’t work with my soundbar because it controlled the ARC, and my TV didn’t like that. I even called their tech support, which was useless and gave me completely wrong advice. I had to do my own research online to figure out what was going wrong and realized that, even though they told me the unit I bought would work with ARC, it absolutely couldn’t, given how my TV controlled it. I wasted a ridiculous amount of time on that. Both units were from Monoprice.I was about to give up and settle for the three-slot Monoprice model when I noticed  this Anker splitter  for cheap and remembered having good luck with their products in the past. It was a third of the price, so I bought it, hooked everything up, and I’ll be damned—it worked perfectly. Setup was much easier, and the remote uses standard batteries instead of those annoying flat ones. Switching is quick, and the picture looks great. I still can’t believe I spent so much on the other brands. At least I can return them.If you’ve been struggling to find an HDMI switch that works, this one is a dream.

When our 12 year old Pioneer AV receiver located in the master bedroom died, I (ok the wife actually...lol) decided that we didn't want to spend the nearly $700 (for now anyway) to replace it with the latest equivalent Pioneer or Denon AV receiver, as we already have a great home theater setup in the living room. Instead, we purchased this 2 into 1 Anker HDMI switch box, and a Fosi 2.1 channel mini amplifier, to replace the Pioneer AV receiver. This combination works very well together for our audio and video needs in the master bedroom now. Albeit, we no longer have ARC/eARC capability in order to control everything, but such is life.This Anker HDMI switch box has a Roku Ultra and a Sony Blu-Ray player connected to the two HDMI inputs, and the single HDMI output is connected to a 40 inch Sony LED TV. Everything is connected with three, 3 foot long Silkland HDMI 2.1/w Ethernet cables. This combination of devices work flawlessly together, and the Anker HDMI switch box switches back and forth between the Roku and Blu-Ray player with no issues at all.The audio is sent from the Sony TV to the Fosi 2.1 channel amplifier via the 3.5 mm audio-out port on the TV. The video and sound both work perfectly, transmitted first through this Anker HDMI switch box, from the Roku and Blu-Ray player to the TV.This Anker HDMI switch box is very small in size, and made of plastic. It is 2-3/16 inches by 2-3/16 inches square, and 1/2 an inch tall. This Anker HDMI switch box takes up no space at all. It also changes input devices with a push of the single button centered on top of the box. There are also 2 faint (not blindingly bright) blue LED lights on top that indicate which HDMI channel the device is currently operating on. The Anker HDMI switch box requires no external power supply, and it runs very cool while operating.Also, while Anker states that this HDMI switch box will transmit 4k @ 60hz video resolution, I cannot verify this as our Sony TV is only capable of 1080p at 120hz (the Roku Ultra is 4k @ 60hz capable, however). In any case, the Anker HDMI switch box does transmit the 1080p resolution flawlessly. I can however verify that this Anker HDMI switch box will transmit both basic 5.1 Dolby and DTS surround sound audio, but most likely won't transmit the higher bandwidth Dolby Atmos or DTS-X 7.2.2 surround sound audio specifications.Overall, I am very impressed with this Anker HDMI switch box. It is small, works very well, and does not require external power to function. However, if the power is turned off to all connected devices, this Anker HDMI switch box will default back to the #1 HDMI input channel, so just make sure that the most often used input device is on that channel. I highly recommend this inexpensive Anker HDMI switch box for anyone that has two HDMI devices, and limited HDMI ports on their TV/monitor (or doesn't want multiple HDMI cables running to the TV), and doesn't want to shell out hundreds of dollars for a home theater AV receiver. Pick up one of these great Anker HDMI switch boxes today!",https://www.amazon.com/Anker-Bi-Directional-Switcher-Compatible-Projector/product-reviews/B0CJT6JBM8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1

For $16.99 (with that sweet 11% discount), it seemed worth a shot.First off, the no-drill mounting is pretty slick. I was worried about messing up the desk, but this thing just clamps on. Easy peasy. The clamps have some anti-scratch pads too, which is nice. It fits desks from about half an inch to 2 inches thick, so it should work for most setups.The tray itself feels pretty solid. It's metal, so it's not gonna snap if you look at it funny. They say it can hold up to 17.6 pounds, which seems like overkill, but hey, better too strong than too weak, right?I like the mesh design. Makes it easy to snake cables in and out without having to disassemble everything. Plus, it keeps things cool, which is good if you've got power bricks down there.Now, it's not all sunshine and rainbows. The 15.7"" length is decent, but if you've got a bigger desk or a ton of cables, you might need to grab a couple. And while the included cable ties and clips are handy, they're nothing fancy.Is it life-changing? Nah. But it does the job. My desk looks a lot cleaner now, and I'm not playing footsie with a tangle of wires anymore.Bottom line: If you're tired of your desk looking like a robot threw up under it, this tray is a solid option. It's not perfect, but for 17 bucks, it's hard to complain. Just don't expect it to solve all your cable management woes in one go.",https://www.amazon.com/Spacecare-Under-Cable-Management-Organizer/product-reviews/B0CVXJB3PB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1

Ah, what a wondrous experience it was!Alas, as I embark on recounting my encounter with this masterpiece, I must confess a sorrowful truth that weighs heavily upon my heart: the abominable monster lurking within its Bluetooth connectivity. At first, it was a beacon of hope, radiating flawless wireless connection for a glorious month. Oh, the melodies danced through the air, embracing my ears with sheer delight!Yet, like an insidious serpent, a poisonous fog began to creep into this sonic paradise. An odd crackle dared to infiltrate the symphony, faint and negligible at first. Alas, my dear friend, that seemingly harmless crackle grew with malicious intent.

This works so much better than computer built in speakers, and a lot better than a clip-on speaker made for computers that was supposed to be good according to reviews here.For a small soundbar it has decent bass and OK stereo imaging. The Bluetooth and the 3.5mm inputs work fine, I haven't had an opportunity to use the subwoofer output so I can't comment on that.The remote works OK, but the various tone controls like music, news, and movie don't seem to do much. The remote doesn't come with batteries, and I guess it didn't claim to come with them, but just have a set of AAA ready if you want to use the remote.The flaw that I hear is hissing instead of proper sound reproduction at low volumes. It sounds like shh-shh-shhh as people are speaking or music is playing. At first I thought it was my computer soundcard, and I tried multiple soundcards, multiple computer settings and multiple software drivers on my computer. I played with turning the volume on this device up, and the computer volume down and vise-versa. Then I tried it with my phone over Bluetooth, and the same shh-shh-shh effect was there.So all I can conclude is it is just that the device is unable to produce usable sound at low volumes, and instead it comes across as noise, scratching or hissing.

Since this soundbar doesn’t have a HDMI connection, and doesn’t allow you to program a remote, I can no longer control the volume without the soundbar remote.  I’ll probably end up replacing this unit so I can return to one remote functioning.I purchased this speaker before for my bedroom, although it had a different name brand, and I didn’t get the subwoofer. I just wanted the cheapest soundbar with good reviews I could find. I was actually surprised by how well it sounded.I decided to replace an older system in my living room.  Since I was happy with my earlier purchase, I searched my orders for the same speaker. When I clicked on buy again I was taken to a speaker that looked exactly the same, but with a different name. The price was still very good, so I decided to go ahead and purchase it this time with the subwoofer. It turns out this is the same speaker, and it sounds even better with the subwoofer.Overall a great deal for a good sounding soundbar.  Small nitpick:  don’t like that you can’t use a programmable remote or cable remote to control the speaker.

EXCELLENT. Based on how satisfied I was with the product, August of this year 2023. I went to my order history and decided that I am going to do a second purchase of the item. I did, however when it arrived, the name on it was (RIOWOIS). I said this can't be good, the very fact it is just a bunch of vowels with some consonants creating a word that can not be pronounce. I realized that this can not be good.Anyways, I unboxed, set up. I realized the audio from AUX is very low, bluetooth connects easily but the sound quality takes too much of a high volume level for you to really get the punch.The OPTICAL connection was what puts this product completely in the trash-can. When I connected the sound bar to my TV OPTICAL connection, there was absolutely no audio sound except for a loud interference similar to a transmission from a two way radio.Why would a seller advertise something with a  different name than what the product actually is? Why? Why would a seller use a different name to sell a product?This action is utterly deceiving, cunning and unfair and this kind of behavior should not make it on amazon. Online shoppers need the truth about a product. Is not like you are walking into a store and being assisted by a store attendant.Even at the point of check out the product was still saying (SAIYIN), it was when the product got shipped, that was the time they updated the name to whatever this is (RIOWOIS).This is misleading and Amazon need to conduct a better stream line of the products that are being sold on their platform.This product is a complete piece of garbage and it needs to be treated for what it is. Toss in the garbage bin. VERY VERY VERY BAD PRODUCT.AUG 25, 2023. Ok, so after receiving my item I was pretty upset based on the distortion that i heard in the system. I wrote my initial review based on how I was feeling. However the seller reached out to me.Very curtious, kind, understanding with a 100% professionalism.

This piece of junk reminds me why. When I needed to replace the Canon that had served me quite well for 6 yrs (prior Canon lasted 5), it was for cosmetic reasons; printer still worked. This time Canons with features I need were all too large and heavy. So I took a chance on Brother. How bad could it be, right? Answer: VERY bad.My main requirement for a printer, besides the obvious, is an ADF. Other lasers I saw with that feature were bulky and heavy. The Brother came and no wonder it was so light. It looked and felt like a toy. I'd say it performed like a toy, but it would have to improve to garner that much credit.First, who the #!%$&* thought it would be a good idea to design a printer that requires user to go in BACK of the printer to clear a paper jam?! Every office I've ever worked in, every home office I've ever had, printers are against a wall. I have yet to see one sitting in the middle of a room. For certain types of jams, I have to pull printer out about a foot or so, turn printer around, then clear the jam.WHY MUST I REPEATEDLY HAVE TO ""RECOVER"" WIRELESS CONNECTION?  No such thing as a quick print job--at least not the first print job of the day. I never turn off the printer, but do turn off my PC every night. Next day, every day, I have to go into printer settings, choose ""Recover WLAN,"" wait about 5-10 minutes for document to print. I've learned to fix breakfast while it warms up, wakes up, or whatever it's doing all that time.Those are the biggies. More minor annoyances:  Screen doesn't stay lit. Very strange defaults, some of which I still don't know how to disable or change--assuming that's even possible. I've used printers for 25+ years. I've had Epson, HP, Canon; Canon being best, but all were ready to go once set up--and stayed ready till they gave out. My 1998 printers were better than this Brother.Okay, so will it print from my phone or tablet?  Yes, both. But that doesn't make up for its many inadequacies.Scan?  Yes. Adequate I suppose.Fax?

I thought that with a Brother printer, things would ""just work"" without too much fuss. It turns out that almost all of the annoyances found in other printers are also found in this one.For starters, Brother's product lines are incomprehensible. Dozens of different printers with different feature sets and inscrutable names. What's the difference between this printer and Brother DCP-L2640DW? The fact that it's not immediately obvious is a major failing on Brother's part. I ended up getting this because it shipped faster, and was surprised at all the useless fax features (they're both marketed as all-in-ones).Setup was a huge pain. Instead of making things easy to work out of the box, they encourage you to download all this software and firmware. After this was done, I'd put over a gigabyte of software onto my computer--three separate programs! And for what? I uninstalled all of them and the printer still works fine.I would strongly avoid this printer if you're looking for something simple, and I would also avoid it unless you desperately need fax functionality for some reason.",https://www.amazon.com/Brother-MFC-L2820DW-Monochrome-Subscription-Replenishment/product-reviews/B0CPL9C83B/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1

I really wanted to like this printer.  Based on another B&W Brother Laser that I already have and has performed flawlessly, I bought this all-in-one.  How could I go wrong?  the other Brother has been great.  This one was effortless to set up.  I just plugged it in, loaded the toner and plugged in to our network.  My Macs recognized it instantly and every print mode seemed to work and it was fast to spit out copies.  But I noticed that both copy and print from computers was kind of dim on the paper.  Pencil sketches appeared splotchy with areas that were almost whited out.  Experimenting, I discovered that the Options menu allows increasing print density temporarily - bingo - that fixed one page!  So logically, if I could just set default print density, then all would be well.  After spending an hour or so online, I could not find a way to set the default print density from the Mac or from the printer control panel.  So on to Brother's online chat support.  They were some help, but they concluded after 2 more hours, that there is NO WAY to adjust default print density from the printer control panel or from my Mac.  Their app can't do it.  Yes, if I could access the printer driver maybe it could do it, but tech support couldn't figure it out.  So choices are 1) have a printer that can't print dark enough or give consistent coverage but that prints quick, or 2) send it back and find another printer.  I decided to send it back.

I don't use a case so I go through a lot of screen protectors, so this will be my sixth order from QHOHQ.  I have always been impressed with the quality of the product for such a low price.  However, I have two issues with the newest protectors I have ordered for my iPhone 16 Pro Max.I broke one my first day of having my new phone, so it served its purpose, but upon installing the second one I saw it had a manufacturing defect.  There are small lines (kind of line the small lines on a ruler) all up the long side of the protector.  I won't be removing the protector because of this defect, it is hard to see when the screen is on (and I will break it soon enough lol).  I haven't opened the third protector yet but hopefully it does not have this flaw.The second issue I have, is the black borders on the protectors. The borders make it so much more noticeable if it is not perfectly lined up, which even with the aligner tool, can be a challenge.  I did manage to get it perfectly aligned, but the screen bezels on the 16 pro max are so small that you can see that the black borders on the protector are larger than the ones on the screen.  It is a hairline difference, and most people probably won't even notice.In the past, I never ordered the ones with the black borders, but that was all that this brand offered for the 16 Pro Max.  if QHOHQ doesn't start offering one without the borders, I will probably be looking at other brands for my next order.",https://www.amazon.com/QHOHQ-iPhone-Pro-Shatterproof-Installation/product-reviews/B0D8B4S9TK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1

I’ve lost glass from the camera protectors all over. In my purse, in my car, on the floor… and the shards have stuck me and made me bleed.

An iPhone, as you know, is an incredibly expensive investment and it really needs to be protected so it can last a long time.When I received this kit, it came with three sets of each of the protectors, which is GREAT! I drive a box truck full time and it’s a bumpy, hard ride. There are times when my phone takes a bit of a beating during the day. Anything I can do to minimize damage to my phone is important.The camera lens protectors are very intuitive to install. Just make sure you clean the lenses prior to sticking in the protector. There are three, as I mentioned, so you have backup for a later date if you need to swap them out. Very cool!The screen protector was a bit tricky for me, only because I hadn’t had previous experience with them. They are hard and I have only had soft protectors in the past. So thank goodness there were three of them because, due to my ignorance, I had trouble installing the first two and threw them away thinking I only had one shot to get them in place (like with a soft protector). This was my mistake. If you place it off-center, you can simply slip your fingernail under the edge, lift it up and reset it. Lol Don’t throw it away, like I did.Use the included alcohol prep pad and wipe to clean your screen before putting on the protector. You want all of the dust and fingerprints off the screen because, once the protector is on, you can’t go back and clean it. Once cleaned, take one of the protectors out of the sleeve. There’s a green tab you can use to pull the film off the back. Make sure you don’t touch where the film was. This side goes against the screen. Pull the film off and use your fingertips to hold the edges. I recommend having the phone in front of you length-wise (sideways) and using two hands to center the protector on top of the screen. Be mindful that there is a small groove cut out on one end that aligns with the top of your screen. Align one edge with your phone and slowly lower the protector so it is even on the edges. The directions say to press in the middle but I found that it will start connecting with the screen on different places. If a bubble forms, simply lift the edge close to the bubble slightly to let the air out and press it down again. It’s easy to do this because it’s a hard protector. Just use small corrections, you don’t have to raise the protector up much, just a tiny bit to let the air out.I got the screen protector on and everything worked perfectly! It wasn’t as noticeable as I thought it would be. It also had NO effect on the touchscreen functions. It’s a great protector kit and works!!!After six months of daily use in a box truck, I began noticing small cracks and was worried that the cracks had gone through to my phone screen. I ordered another kit (because remember, being an idiot the first round, I had thrown out two of the protectors for no reason). I just peeled off my screen protector and I was AMAZED that, although the protector was cracked in many places, my phone screen was in PERFECT condition! Not even a little scratch or small dent. Nothing. Just like new. I took a picture and added it to show you the first protector and my phone screen. I just put my second protector on and it was easy to install! I learned after my first round last year. :)So please buy this if you care about your phone. It’s amazingly scratch resistant, the kit is awesome and generous with multiple back up protectors … and it works!",https://www.amazon.com/QHOHQ-iPhone-Pro-Shatterproof-Installation/product-reviews/B0D8B4S9TK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1

Great service.This is the first time I've used this screen protector brand. The camera lens protectors were fine. No problems applying them and clarity is good. However, the screen protectors are a completely different story. I tried the first one using the frame guide and the wipes to clean the screen. After the screen was applied I tried to squeegee out the bubbles but they were at least 5 or 6 that would not come out and did not disappear after a day. I had to remove it and you can't really reuse the screen protector. Then I tried the second one and same issue with bubbles remaining between the glass and the screen. Had to remove that one too. Finally, I tried the third one and it gently released the adhesive throughout the screen. Squeegee out a few small bubbles and this one was perfect. Really disappointing that if this one cracks, I have no spares left. I've used many other iPhone tempered glass screen protectors over the last 4 or 5 years and none of them have ever had this problem with bubbles remaining trapped. It's likely a defect in the adhesive not being uniformly spread as it contacts with the screen.",https://www.amazon.com/QHOHQ-iPhone-Pro-Shatterproof-Installation/product-reviews/B0D8B4S9TK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1

Also I don't usually review anything but I was amazed at how quick, straightforward and flawless the installation went. Zero bubbles, looks great, and took all of 3 minutes to install. Last time I had my Verizon guy install a thinner, typical protector it took 2 tries and the cost of the protector was almost $70. Granted, I installed this on a pristine and very clean brand new iPhone 16 Pro Max, but I'm amazed at the technology used to adhere this to the phone with no bubbles. Just follow the easy instructions. I have no idea how they make money on these things since they give you three sets. This works out to about $10 each at the time of my purchase (using Prime).

Unknown,R197Y9YO0YSBO5,Critical,"Sony 85 Inch 4K Ultra HD TV X90L Series: BRAVIA XR Full Array LED Smart Google TV with Dolby Vision HDR and Exclusive Features for The PlayStation® 5 XR85X90L- Latest Model,Black",4.4,3.0,528,"I should have known a Google tv would be creepily intrusive and buggy.After hanging the tv, I went through the basic set up process, skipping the option to sign into a Google account, because, why? The process still took several minutes, and in the end I ended up with two different TV inputs, one of which didn’t work and was somehow the default. I only have one tv - the set up process  actually asks you to set up tv twice. At one point it even told me to switch my HDMI input too. I thought this was a nice tip - “use this input for better quality because when you set this up the first time it wasn’t optimal” - but little did I know it was trying to configure a second tv input. Which, why did it recognize my tv signal and then ask me to set up another input WITH THE SAME SIGNAL? I’m one of those who read all instructions, and no where did it make it clear what was happening. The setup process is long and not totally clear.So after the setup, the tv watching interface is actually nice. It tried to get the remote to sync with my cable box, but that didn’t work, no biggie. The basic user interface is nice. You can switch inputs while still watching tv. Navigating and downloading apps is simple.The remote control feels good in your hand and seems simple enough. It has 2 “settings” buttons…one with a gear icon and one with a wrench icon, that do different things, go figure. There is a pause/play button, but no fast forward/rewind, so I had a hard time navigating to my favorite spot in Avatar 2. The remote has pre-set buttons for Netflix, Prime Video, Disney+, YouTube, crunchyroll, and Bravia core. These are the only apps you can use without signing into a Google account, unfortunately.So in order to download Max and Paramount+, I started the process to sign into a Google account. This experience was amazingly bad. There was no option to use a QR code or other device to sign in - I had to type my email into the tv using the remote. And then the worst part - it hit me with a CAPTCHA. Except you can’t use the remote control to choose all the pictures with traffic lights or motorcycles. The remote control literally does nothing on the CAPTCHA screen. At this point I was blocked. Couldn’t sign into my account, couldn’t back out of the screen, couldn’t get past the CAPTCHA. Turning the tv off and on brought me right back there. How could this process get past the QA team?So I found instructions online to factory reset the tv. This time I went through and signed into my Google account in the initial setup process. This time was much smoother with no QR code. Tip: if you intend to use the smart features of this tv, sign into Google upfront.I haven’t yet mentioned the number of opt-out options there are going through set up. You have to agree to various privacy policies and 3rd party agreements. Anyone remember the old days of downloading shareware and having to click “I don’t accept” to all the bloat-ware that would try to be installed? That’s what I was reminded of. There are at least 6 different things I had to say no to. And of course the tv doesn’t really give you hints on what is required or optional, from Sony or from Google or another 3rd party. It was like walking through a row of carnival barkers.I’ve bought several other tvs recently (two last Christmas) that were not Google tvs, and those experiences bore no resemblance to this privacy-stealing circus.But wait, you still can’t use all the features - like the “power on” experience - unless you also register the tv using an email. I can’t believe a tv this expensive requires so much data from you.Let’s talk about the picture quality. It’s crisp and has dark darks. It doesn’t have any banding or compression artifacts (you know, those fuzzy spots in dark scenes) like I did on my last tv. It is quite dim by default, even with eco-mode turned off, but changing the image mode to “vibrant” brightened everything up. The annoying frame interpolation mode is on by default, but what tv doesn’t do that nowadays. At least it’s a better quality interpolation.The back of the tv is nicely designed, with inputs and power plug located on the edges of the tv, where they’re easy to reach while the tv is still mounted. The VESA holes are kind of low, which means the tv sits higher than you’d expect when mounting. You might want to get very long mounting brackets so you have more adjustment options.The processor on the tv is fast too. It starts up pretty quickly, and navigating menus or starting/switching apps is responsive and smooth. Sound quality is fine, nothing to write home about.So to summarize, the basic things you’d watch this tv for are good, but not amazing. The rest of the experience made me go into a green Hulk rage. I would not recommend spending $1300 on this tv. You can get just as nice picture quality without the hassle for much less. You’d think a Google subsidy would actually make this tv cheaper. I won’t get another Google tv, but this one I think should only be in the $700 range.",https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Inch-Ultra-X90L-Playstation%C2%AE/product-reviews/B0BYPLRJQF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1

First and foremost, this television has exceptional picture quality. It nearly matches the quality of OLED sets, but at a much better price. In addition to the better price, this TV is not susceptible to the burn-in and fading to which OLED sets are prone. Sony has always been famous for exceptional picture quality and this set will not disappoint. If you are like me and your main criteria for choosing a television are picture quality and price, then this is the ideal set for you since it is a great balance between quality and price - offering exceptional picture quality at at good price.Of course, with any item there is room for improvement. After using this set quite a lot before I wrote this review I can honestly state that both the Wi-Fi and Bluetooth are sub-standard. The Wi-Fi is prone to being dropped for no reason at all. For example, I have an Amazon Fire TV stick plugged into one of the HDMI ports of this et, so it is obviously in exactly the same position relative to the Wi-Fi router, yet the TV often drops the Wi-Fi connection when the Fire TV stick has no issues at all. This is surprising because the Fire TV stick is behind the TV and that undoubtedly blocks some portion of the Wi-Fi signal, yet it has a better Wi-Fi connection than the TV. Similarly, the Bluetooth is also troublesome, although it is a different issue. The trouble with the Bluetooth is that when I switch apps on the TV, the Bluetooth connection to my headphones often drops. I often have to re-pair my headphones every time I change apps. I find this unacceptable. The Fire TV stick plugged into the TV has no such issue.The remote control unit is only fair. I like that it has voice commands and a light sensor to adjust the picture, but it is poor in several other regards. It has no backlight, so using it in a dark room is pretty much impossible - the buttons do not even glow in the dark like the remote for my AV receiver. The remote also has neither numbers, nor letters, so entering numbers or text into the TV is painfully slow. There are also no dedicated fast forward or rewind buttons.Unlike some other brands like LG and Samsung, I found the technical documentation for this set to be quite good. The included instructions were basic, but clear and legible with good English grammar and spelling.  If you want more advanced technical specs for this set, they are readily available online.I use this TV with the Bravia Cam webcam. This is a webcam specifically made to be used with selected Bravia televisions. The Bravia Cam can, of course, be used as a webcam for video conferencing on the TV with Google Meet and other similar apps. The Bravia Cam also enables the TV to automatically adjust the picture for the room, and the sound for your seating position. The Bravia Cam also can put the TV into power saving mode when nobody is in front of the TV. The Bravia Cam also allows the TV to be controlled by hand gestures, although I found this feature to be very problematic. The real problem with the gesture control system is that it relies on the camera, and the camera needs light to function, so the whole system does not work in a darkened room. I find it ironic that the gesture control system does not work in the dark because the remote has no backlight and so it also does not work in the dark. So whether you wish to use the remote or the gesture control system, you will need to turn on some lights in order to control this television.Overall, I think this is an excellent TV. It seems to me that picture quality and price would be the top criteria for most TV shoppers and in my opinion, there is no better picture quality for the price available out there. Combined with the great reputation of Sony for picture quality and reliability, I think this is an excellent television for the price. Of course there are better televisions out there, but they also come with a much higher price. This set is in the sweet spot where you get a really wonderful picture for a reasonable price. I give it five stars.",https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Inch-Ultra-X90L-Playstation%C2%AE/product-reviews/B0BYPLRJQF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1

I love all Sony products. Been buying them for 35 years or more. The Sony Bravia TV is one of the best. I remember back in 2000 the original one. It was awesome. Lasted me 15 years. I then bought a Sony X85J for my bedroom in 2022. I love it so much that I now bought this one for my Man cave game/sports room. Today, I turned it on and calibrated it. WOW, can I say that the picture looks so much better than out of the box. Calibration took me 45 minutes. I found all the settings online. This TV is awesome!! It is well made, looks great. I even mounted it onto the wall stand myself. It weighs 55lbs with the bracket rails on it. Very easy to lift up yourself. I sit 7 feet Away so I get the wow effect. The picture is super sharp, crisp, clear. You can really see the colors pop out at your especially after my calibration that I used. Everything runs well. I love how Sony builds their TV's. It is solid!! They definitely package them well. No issues with it. It was delivered one day early from Amazon. Great delivery service. They were very careful with the TV.

My last TV was a 42""1080p, which was decent, but this thing is on a whole other level!The picture on this thing is so good! My cable TV only lets me get decent picture, but when I turn on my Xbox Series X and play a 4k game or watch a DVD or downloaded video I get to see what this thing is capable of, and I love it! I don't see any problems with it at all. I'm not a videophile or expert, but when I saw a random comment here and there about a random thing being a small issue with their TV I tried to recreate the same thing and never got anything that would ever remotely qualify as a problem. Maybe I'm just not sensitive enough, but to me this TV is pretty much perfect.One of the nicest surprises of the TV is the sound it puts out! I was kind of expecting decent sound because I've seen that some modern TVs (like my last one) have what is essentially like a little mini soundbar built into the bottom of the TV when they're big enough. Since my last 42"" sounded good I hoped this would too. Well I was NOT disappointed!  The sound is really clear, and gets more than loud enough for my small living room (20'x30'). I have never turned it up past 40 and I'm pretty sure it goes up to 100. It's not going to shake the house or make your ears bleed since there's no sub woofer or anything, but for a TV I can't help but to be impressed.Actually, not only is there good sound coming from the bottom of the TV, but Sony seems to have done some kind of magic with speakers mounted in the back on the side of the TV up towards the top. These things can throw sound around the room and create a kind of surround sound. I don't know how they do it, because there isn't even a speaker grill or anything back there, the sound just comes through the plastic. I only noticed because I was standing next to it and heard them. It's a cool feature I wasn't expecting.As I sit here typing this I have the TV on and I'm sitting in a menu for Forza Motorsport. The sounds of the menu music really seem like they're coming from the sides, and even behind me a little bit. The sound from this TV really impresses me. More than a few times since I bought it I'll think I hear something outside to my left, but it's just the TV doing it's thing. It's great!One thing to note is that this TV is heavy. I believe the box said 70lbs when it was delivered. I have it mounted on the wall and I needed a friend to help me so I didn't risk breaking anything. So if you see the listed weight on here and think that other TVs are so much lighter and easy to pick up so it must be a typo, it isn't. This thing is so much heavier than I thought it would be.I know there are better TVs out there, but they cost a lot more. I believe Sony pushed the tech in this kind of TV about as far as they can, and in my opinion they did an amazing job. It isn't the latest and greatest, but I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this TV. If you're on the fence, do it! I think you'll be happy. You've probably done enough research to be  where you're wondering if you should pull the trigger. Well I think you should. I don't think you'll be disappointed. I'm so happy I bought this thing! I'll update if anything changes, but part of the reason I bought this is because Sony is supposed to build TVs that last much longer than others. We'll see. Right now I couldn't be happier.",https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Inch-Ultra-X90L-Playstation%C2%AE/product-reviews/B0BYPLRJQF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1
Unknown,R37H0R6Y6Z0A7Z,Positive,"Sony 85 Inch 4K Ultra HD TV X90L Series: BRAVIA XR Full Array LED Smart Google TV with Dolby Vision HDR and Exclusive Features for The PlayStation® 5 XR85X90L- Latest Model,Black",4.4,4.0,528,"I really tried to like this TV, but the S95B has definitely spoiled me... even after all the nerfs and downright bad updates. The X90L just doesn't hold a candle to an OLED in HDR content. The processing really does carry this TV though. The way it's able to focus on highlights with so few dimming zones is impressive. I was also very pleased with the motion and sharpening features.Unfortunately, it just doesn't do well enough. In darker content, especially anything with black bars, the image would look washed out in those scenarios. I tested only a few movies, but I really wasn't pleased with how dark HDR was and how it inherently forced the Sony to struggle. In SDR content, I was consistently blown away by the brightness compared to my OLED. It even came close in color, but it didn't have the deep reds that the S95B had.User interface: This was one of my biggest gripes with the TV. None of the menus and apps use your TV's settings or local dimming, so everything looks pretty bad unless you're playing content. Another problem I had was with the settings menu not saving my motion settings and also not having separate presets for HDR and SDR. I like to use DCI color for SDR and keep it on Auto for HDR, but I have to switch them back and forth every time. It also just feels kinda clunky sometimes.Sound: I have the TV set up on a table with the lowest feet adjustment, and all I can say is it sounds tinny... The speakers have almost no noticeable bass, even with it boosted in the EQ. The cinema mode was the best sound mode, but I would definitely recommend a sound bar. I personally use a pair of Jamo S803 bookshelf speakers with a Yamaha RV685 receiver (the receiver is definitely overkill). Also, the S95B murders this TV in the sound department too.So, my conclusion is that it's all right for the price. I didn't enjoy it that much for gaming, as my panel had pretty noticeable DSE, and it looked surprisingly blurry in motion, even for LCD standards. The SDR performance is great and almost eye-searingly bright, but HDR falls flat and doesn't give the contrast you need for most content. Demo content looks good, but movies/shows are typically mastered a lot darker and will show this TV's weaknesses.For what it offers, I think it should be less expensive, and from what I've seen in-store, the U8K is much better overall. I bought this TV because I wanted a 65-inch over my 55-inch and also wanted to see if the brightness would win me over, but the only time it's brighter is in SDR, and the S95B crushes it in HDR, no contest. I would recommend an S90C instead for HDR and gaming.",https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Inch-Ultra-X90L-Playstation%C2%AE/product-reviews/B0BYPLRJQF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1

Unknown,RX41LA3A9LM40,Positive,"Sony 85 Inch 4K Ultra HD TV X90L Series: BRAVIA XR Full Array LED Smart Google TV with Dolby Vision HDR and Exclusive Features for The PlayStation® 5 XR85X90L- Latest Model,Black",4.4,4.0,528,"This is a good middle-of-the road TV.  It has some great performance features for the class. The standout strengths are excellent brightness, motion interpolation and a good deal of configurability.  Its Playstation 5 “awareness” allows it to automatically optimize for the console when plugged in, and make the most out of advanced features like VRR and ALLM. The real stand-out feature here is the motion interpolation or “smoothness” as the menu calls it - it’s hands down the best I’ve ever seen.  My privacy matters to me, so this review was conducted without enabling the WiFi or using any of the online features.Packaging: AThis TV ships in a very plain cardboard box, which kind of screams “no frills”, but it has a good many features despite.  It’s possible to get the TV out without deconstructing the box - which is a plus in my opinion as if you keep the box you have a safe way to transport it if you’re about to move or whatnot.Physical Setup: A+This has to be the simplest TV setup I’ve done since the switch from CRTs to flat panels.  The desktop stand is just two feet that plug into the bottom and snap into place - no tools needed.  The TV also comes with three sets of mounting screws.  This is kind of a big deal as I have the absolute worst luck when it comes to mounting kits- they usually come with five or six different screw options and none of them is ever the correct one for the TV I’m trying to set up.  Providing the screws with the TV means I’m not going to be making a trip to the hardware store before I can mount it.All of the connections are clearly labeled on the back panel.  If you’re installing this with a flush wall mount, you might want to try to plug everything in before you mount it on the wall because there’s not a lot of room to maneuver behind the set once it’s mounted.Remote: CThe remote control unfortunately follows this minimalist trend where rather than have any direct functions on the remote, every function opens some kind of on screen menu that you have to use to operate it.On TV Controls: DThe TV itself only has two controls - a one-button-does-everything “power” button, and a physical toggle switch to give you the illusion of being able to physically disable the microphone in the TV.  If you lose your remote control, you’re going to be extremely limited in what you can do with this TV.OTA Reception: CThe over-the-air channel reception isn’t very good.  During the scan it picked up 33 channels including HD and SD, but when I attempted to view the HD channels picked up by the scan they wouldn’t come in at all.  (I used the antenna from my 2013 Sony, which does get all of those channels, to test.)  The SD channels come in just fine which makes me think there’s something wrong with the tuner itself.  If you’re planning on using this for OTA, you might have to upgrade or buy a better antenna.Privacy: DLike all “Smart” TVs, the manufacturer utilizes the TV to gather information about your watching habits, and record and analyze audio from the viewing environment. As mentioned earlier, they try to give you some sense of privacy with a physical toggle switch for the TV’s microphone, but it’s just an illusion. The TV has an audio calibration function which plays a sound then listens to the echo to set up the speakers; it has no trouble doing this even with the microphone switch set to the “off” position.  This means that either the microphone can still be activated in software despite the physical toggle switch, or that there’s at least one more microphone built into the set which is not controlled by the switch.  Either way, don’t assume that you aren’t being listened to because the microphone is switched off.If privacy is a priority for you, I would recommend not enabling WiFi on this TV at all. You can get firmware updates from Sony and install them with a USB drive, and if you want to use Netflix, Amazon etc… you’re much better off using an external device like a Firestick, Chromecast or XBOX.Default Settings: B-All of the default picture modes have the awful “Sharpness” control turned up to the point where it creates visible artifacts and ringing. Almost all of the picture modes have the brightness and contrast cranked to their highest levels, but other than Sharpness, the default configurations are very passable. I don’t know who actually prefers the damage the sharpness feature does to the image, but I very strongly recommend that the first thing you do every time you change a picture mode is to lower the Sharpness its lowest level.The Sharpness was not the only default setting that caused some picture degradation. The “Reality Creation” feature describes itself as a super sampling..  Super sampling takes advantage of the fact that when you take a higher resolution image and scale it down to a lower resolution image it seems to maximize the detail possible at the lower resolution. Connect something like a Blu-ray player to an old standard definition CRT TV and you’ll have some idea of what I mean.  In this case Reality Creation seems to be scaling the image up, performing some kind of edge interpolation, then scaling it back down. With the feature enabled the image noticeably lost fidelity on most 1080p content. Film grain and other noise inherent to the image was transformed into splotchy glittery patterns which looked terrible to my eyes. I also recommend turning this off unless you’re watching some awful low-resolution source where it might actually do some good.Gaming: B-This TV supports all of the most recent gaming features - Automatic Low Latency Mode (ALLM), Variable Refresh Rate (VRR), and it supports 4K@120Hz.  This TV recognized my Playstation 5 and the two devices negotiated a configuration that took advantage of all the features.  The gaming mode is a little bit barebones - it does have a crosshair overlay, but it doesn’t have a frame counter so it’s difficult to tell what performance you’re getting without external tools.  Even in gaming mode display lag is between 30 and 19 milliseconds (measured with a Time Sleuth). For modern gaming, this is fine for 99% of players.  Competitive gamers generally aim for something in single-digits, and for retro gamers this is at the high end of tolerability.  By itself 19 milliseconds (best case scenario) is not going to make retro games unplayable, but remember display lag is just one factor in the input latency stack (the time from when you press a button to when you see the action on screen). With display lag this high, it leaves less room for error from your wireless controllers or scaler.  For my testing I used a MiSTer FPGA and a very low latency 2.4Ghz retro-bit controller to play Mega Man 2.  The game is fairly unforgiving of lag so I often use it as my real-world lag test and I had no trouble completing a couple of stages and boss fights the display lag here was not noticeable to me.Advanced Picture Features: B+If picture quality is a priority, I would recommend taking the time to dial in the settings according to some objective process - there are plenty of calibration tutorials online.I’ve already mentioned my thoughts on “Reality Creation” which does things to the image I don’t like. Super Sampling means that the image is scaled up, smoothed out and scaled back down.  In theory this helps with anti-aliasing, but in practice it took away some of the natural sharpness and added noise. YMMV.The black levels and HDR tone mapping emphasis are all pretty effective at dramatic changes in the image quality.  When playing games like Doom Eternal I was able to really dial in a great picture.Motion Features: A+This set has three levels of black frame insertion (what it calls “clarity”).  This makes the transition from one drawn frame to the next less jarring by inserting a blank frame in between. Each level sacrifices brightness to do this so the higher levels are kind of impractical because of how dim they make the picture, but it’s still a good feature to have to lessen eye strain.Where this TV really stands out to me is its motion interpolation capabilities.  This is a feature where the TV takes advantage of its very fast refresh rate to invent (interpolate) in-between frames to make on-screen motion smoother and more stable. I’ve been watching this technology evolve over the last 15 years or so, and what they’ve been able to achieve here is stunning - even compared to Samsung’s top of the line 2023 TVs.  A major drawback of this feature is artifacting - this is when the circuitry tries to guess what the in-between frame should look like but gets it wrong and draws weird patterns around moving objects.  It can be very immersion-breaking.  This TV put up with the most punishing material I could throw at it and barely broke a sweat.  At the highest setting, there were still periodic artifacts, but at the second highest setting, I counted one instance of artifacting during the whole Super Mario Bros. movie.  The 2021 Dune has a lot of vertical panning and fast moving objects and this TV made them look solid and smooth.Contrast Enhancement: D“Full Array LED” is straight-up false advertising.  For this to actually have what “Full Array LED” describes using a reasonable understanding of those words, it would have one backlight LED for every pixel.  In practice it’s not even close.  With the local dimming feature enabled, white text on a dark background is constantly surrounded by a very obvious glow from a larger section of the backlight being brightened around the actually bright material onscreen.  Thankfully you can turn local dimming off.Viewing Angle: B-While you can make out detail that’s fairly similar to the correct color from almost 180 degrees off-center, anything wider than 95 degrees is slightly washed out.  If you’re used to LCD TVs already you’re not going to notice this at all.Ambient Light Rejection (Reflections): B+The matte-ish surface of the screen does a very effective job diffusing reflections.  Obviously you still don’t want to set this up opposite a sunny window, but a lamp or a crack in the curtains is not going to ruin your viewing experience.Brightness: B+This TV has the ability to get almost painfully bright which, combined with its ability to reject ambient light which makes it ideal for use in normally to well lit rooms.Built-in Speakers: BThe built-in speakers are serviceable.  They’re maybe one notch below the quality you’d get with an expensive sound bar.  There are a ton of presets and even an auto calibration (which I’ve mentioned earlier) to adjust the sound to your listening environment.  I found the “Dolby” setting to be the best all-around, though I’m at a loss for what particular “Dolby” technology is at work here.Final Score: B-This is a good all-around LCD TV with a solid set of features, but it doesn’t really excel at most of them.  Viewing angles, display lag and local dimming are all somewhat disappointing while not being exactly terrible.  Ambient light rejection, brightness, motion enhancements and ease of setup are the high points here.",https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Inch-Ultra-X90L-Playstation%C2%AE/product-reviews/B0BYPLRJQF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1

And I'm only using 2 of the outlets and 2 of the USB ports.(=) The Verdict: If you plan on installing this in a location where this wouldn't bother you, it works fine. I usually purchase things to love it but in this case, unfortunately, I have to return. Other than this, it would have been a great product.",https://www.amazon.com/Extension-Tcstei-Ultra-Thin-Protector-Essentials/product-reviews/B0CWNW9LHS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1

I use the HDMI (digital) port for connection, but it's nice that this monitor also has a VGA (analog) input option as VGA is a past standard for older computers.  To my eyes the brightness and colors are great right out of the box, and the picture is very clear.  I don't play fast-action video games, so I can't comment on how well it works for those.  But for text, spreadsheets, and normal web browsing (including YouTube) this works very well.Positives:IPS (for me) is preferable to VA type monitors.  It's a small difference but if you are picky, here's IPS.The border is very thin, thus you've got maximum usable screen space with almost no waste.The price was incredible at $120.  I see that it's now $160 and I think still a good value there.Great picture right out of the box.VESA wall (or arm) mountable.Choice of HDMI or VGA input.Looks good with the power on or off.Potential negatives (for some people):Provided base is very wide at the bottom, and possibly difficult to attach to monitor.  I tried briefly to attach the screen to the base, instructions say something about turning it to attach securely - I couldn't figure out how to attach it securely.  This didn't matter to me because I planned to use a ""monitor arm"" (I have one from MOUNTUP) and that works great on my computer desk which is about 1"" thick.  But if you want to use the included base, I'm not sure how to attach it securely, and I might ding it a star for that.The AC to DC power convertor (aka power supply) is inside the monitor, which gives it an elegant look vs. a separate power supply.  However, if the power supply dies, good luck replacing it.  At the price paid this is ok, and might even be preferable for some people.The power cord and connections to the computer (HDMI or VGA) attach upward from the bottom, rather than straight into the back.  Again this looks more elegant but I would prefer straight into the back, as that is easier to attach.  You might need to do some fumbling around before you get it all connected.The monitor is adjustable for brightness, colors, on/off etc. from the back of the unit on the right side.  These are easily reached by ""feel"" once you know where they are, and which is which.  One of the switches starts an on-screen ""menu"" that you can navigate.  I made it appear but haven't tried to adjust it.  This is probably how all monitors adjust now, but I preferred the old days when monitors had 5 or so physical switches on the front or bottom edge, so you could change brightness, color hue, etc.  Of course those monitors were also much more expensive than today's monitors, for a smaller picture that wasn't as good as today's.  Just saying that if you want to change the settings, it may take some fumbling to get the hang of it.It doesn't have the pixel density of more expensive monitors, but for my use I don't need it the higher density.  To me the picture and text looks really good from where I sit, which is about 2 feet away.Overall this is fantastic for my uses as a VESA-mounted non-gaming monitor, and incredible at the price I paid.  The only frustration I can imagine is if you use the included base/stand and can't figure out how to secure it to the screen (there must be a way, I would think, but I didn't try very hard since I was going to use an external ""arm"" mount anyway).  Or if you do fast-action gaming, maybe it's not as good as some, but I have no idea about that.",https://www.amazon.com/Zero-Frame-Monitor-FreeSync-Technology-Refresh/product-reviews/B0CYDLX8XW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1

With that in mind:This is a remarkably good monitor. It has in its favor:1. The picture is very sharp. I have bad vision and I can read it without my glasses!2. The picture is more than bright enough, even in a well lit room.3. The blacks and contrast are wonderful.4. The color is beautuful. Maybe if I was doing PROFESSIONAL photofinishing or video production I might quibble, but then again maybe not.5. It is excellent even for my style of gaming (Quake2, Alien Arena, Super Tux Cart, etc.) so the drop to 100 Hz from 144 Hz really isn't very noticable.6. Even though I have the VA panel version, I have not been bothered by ""ghosting"" at all, even at 100 Hz.7. Although I would have liked a metal stand, the plastic with some metal stand that comes with it is quite sturdy. And its easily wall mountable. (In fact, I now have it VESA mounted on a desktop stand that rotates it between landscape and portrait orientation.)Against it:1. If I really try I can tell a slight difference between it's 100 Hz and my Nitro 5's built in 144 Hz, but only using the type of really intense games that I do not generally play. And even then I can still play them.2. I have no need for a VGA port, and it has only 1 HDMI port. But, an external HDMI switch can be quite inexpensive, even with remote control, especially considering the low cost of the monitor. I got a 3-1 switch so I could connect my computer, a TV tuner and an Amazon Fire stick.All in all, for me, this is a really great monitor. I will almost certainly end up with one or two more in the series. I have to say that Acer really outdid itself with this one as to value for $$$. Well done Acer!Addendum. I should have mentioned this. This monitor has no speakers/sound, To use the HDMI switch and use this to watch TV I had to put a HDMI audio extractor between the switch and the monitor and connect the audio output to a small external amplifier. Ended up with very good sound.

I use these monitors well over 10 hours/day, so had no reservations in getting the larger displays.The lower tier are all Acer 27” monitors, 3 of which are over 4 years old and the 4th just added.

It worked great on the center console and door handles.Next I took it to work. Time to clean the server closets. If you have ever seen one there is a ton of wire to contend with. That limits how much air can be blown as the wire acts as an obstruction. With the power of this unit I did not have to worry about that. It cut my leaning time by 30%.It charges in a timely manner and you get a good amount of run time. It is also small and light to pack with the included bag.I was surprised at the amount of air this unit pushes out. It has 3 speeds so it is nice to be able to regulate the flow to your desire. This will pay for itself by not having to buy canned air. I use canned air in the shop to just do general dust offs. No more as this unit will replace that.

It does an incredible job of creating a steady stream of air without the condensation you get from canned air. I can use the device to clean electronics without concern of the humidity damaging or shorting out anything. I also discovered that I can use it to clean my Tiffany lamps safely. It allows me to get the dust out from around the soldering without any pressure. Another fine use for this handy device is I have a mineral collection which gets dusty, but is next to impossible to clean unless you use canned air, which can get very expensive.The charge lasted for extremely long time, allowing to clean various items at one time.

With this kit I'm able to brush stuck dust loose (dryly) and let it blow out safely. The multiple speeds are very useful for using around computer fans or a home fan as computer fans are very delicate and don't want them to spin on their own.  I've even done some dusting around the house which worked out great also.

If you're reading this, I'm guessing you're doin same thing I Was, basically lookin for ANY bad review, bc usually the only folks who comment on products are the UNhappy ones, but I had to scroll through literally like, 40 or 50, & STILL couldn't really find a SINGLE bad review, overwhelmingly positive. They charge quickly, u get USB-C charging, so it's fast, not sure If they do that ""quick charge"" thing the high-end ones do, where u can charge for like 5-10 minutes & get like 8 MORE hours, even from a partial charge, but even if not, these are STILL, WELL worth it.  The one downside, is minor, the ""transparency"" mode, does kinda sound like you're underwater. If you're not familiar w/the newer tech, it let's u press a button, switches from 1) regular sound 2) Noise-cancelling mode 3) ""Transparency"" mode, which allows you to hear what's goin on around u, w/out havin to take the unit 🎧  itself, off your head. I totally get what people meant by it sounding like you're underwater, but it still works relatively well...plus it's not really the type mode you're gonna spend much time in, kinda more for minor emergencies, or just an additional convenience to hear another person for example, w/out havin 2 physically take em off your 👂 ears. I'm sure like nearly all products, if you're not happy, u can return, but I can't imagine why u would. Oh, 1 thing, be CAREFUL about the color, for some reason, they had a few colors like Blue, I think like red or pink, & one other, they were 10$ cheaper I believe, but the black ones I think look better, & had a sale which saved quite a bit, I think it was like 50% off or somethin, PLUS ➕️ an ADDITIONAL 10% off coupon, not sure if that would be eligible for everyone, but was for me, which made it even MORE of a no-brainer 🧠 to buy. The sound, even in ""normal"" mode, is SURPRISINGLY good, even it blocks 🚫 out a decent amount of sound on its own, but when you hit into the Noise-cancelling mode, they sound EVERY bit as good, as my much older Bose ones, from back in the day. They were like maybe, 7 or 8 years old I guess, give or take, if anything these might be BETTER.  I'm sure there's a few things the Sony/Bose ones do better, but here you're paying LITERALLY like 10% of that. I thought for SURE it sounded ""too good to be true"", but so far, I now understand why the reviews were so overwhelmingly positive, I had a hard time finding even ONE bad one. They fit well, pretty comfortable, my major in college basically required 🎧, & these sound just as good as the numerous Sony models we used. Of course the highest level ones, that cost like $250 or MORE, will probably sound a LITTLE better, but I've used probably a dozen or so different brands & models over the years, & if u did a ""blind sound test"", I'd say easily 9/10 people wouldn't be able to even tell ANY substantial  difference. JBL has a pair for like 100$, I think that was even the sale price, but had MANY reviews that were horrific, & people even had several photos or videos showing how cheap they looked, & broke w/a QUICKNESS, I was honestly surprised 😮 the MORE expensive ones, had VASTLY worse overall reviews. I can't speak on Longevity yet, but they charge quickly, sound VERY good, feel comfortable enough to use for long time, & of course, the price is UNBELIEVABLY good. Others @ this price, have MANY bad reviews from unhappy customers, but here I struggled to find ANY. I don't even usually do many reviews, unless I'm VERY happy/surprised, or very unhappy w/a product, these are DEFINITELY worth taking a chance on. I recommend waiting on a sale, & keep an 👁 eye out, for the additional coupon thing u have to hit the ✔️ ✅️ check mark button to receive, but ANY price around 30$, you're gonna be straight up SHOCKED w/these, I was. That's about all I can think of, bass is solid, price is fantastic, comfortable, not very heavy or anything, even WITHOUT the Noise-cancelling, the sound is great & even STILL blocks a decent amount of sound, WITHOUT even activating the Noise-cancelling mode. I wasnt familiar w/the developers who made these, but so far, @ least short-term, I Would give em literally like a 9 to 9.5 out of 10. Even the higher end ones, like beats by Dre, have more bad reviews than these...possibly bc more people bought em overall? Not sure, but you'll not find a better set of headphones 🎧 anywhere CLOSE to these, for this price. Very impressive.  If anything, I'm usually MORE skeptical than most people, but I don't see how anyone could be disappointed w/these, especially for the price.

I was also interested in the temp tracking which I wanted to use to track my cycles better.Heres what I didn't like and my thoughts.The rings can be exspensive.

I opted for silver instead.I found myself missing the utility of my watch. With your ring you can't tell time, you can't use it to find your phone, can't make payments, answer your phone, etc. But also I was disappointed in what oura had to offer.The temp tracking was not quantitative data - it just tells you +/- from your baseline.

I know that the ring can detect patterns and let you know when you might be getting sick, etc. but within the app I wasn't satisfied with this.Oura is not accepted anywhere for motion tracking/fitness tracking, so you miss out on other apps, etc. where you would need to sync up your tracker.Although it detects walking, running, and cycling very well - that's about it. You can live record only those three (indoor/outdoor) - and any other kind of workout you have to add to your activity after the thought. but just adding it what you did and for how long. I didn't like this. They also use a tagging feature - which I understand but feels like its too much effort.Yes you get slightly more detailed biometric data, but I felt the app was kind of lackluster. The interface is nice but felt lacking and slightly overwhelming all at the same time. They do a good job noting optimal levels vs where you need to pay attention, but that's really about it.I will likely return my Oura ring and get a new apple watch. I was initally really only wanted to try oura for the temp tracking and cycling tracking, but I don't like how the temp tracking is done, and there is virtually nothing for cycle tracking aside from just marking when your cycle starts. You also have to pay for an oura subscription and if you wanted more in depth cycle tracking - pay for natural cycles (not required but they partner together).With the newer apple wathces you can now get everything that oura offers, plus the utility of watch, phone, and payment system - and with new features like temp tracking and etc. you can get more out of the already built in apple apps. And then you can download apps where you might need to fill in the gaps.",https://www.amazon.com/Oura-Ring-Gen3-Sizing-Kit/product-reviews/B0CYWC18G8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1

It takes about 2 weeks for the ring to get to know you and give accurate daily insight. It has really helped me see my sleep issues and get a handle on my stress etc.The problem came once the ring wouldn't sync with the app. I followed the generic instructions given on the site but nothing works. So then I get 'help' via the chst. Which is an AI chat bot. Those suggestions don't work so then I get 'technical ' support from a live human who is utterly useless doing the same thing the bot walked me through. Nothing worked. I'm sure it was something simple had I had someone to speak to on the phone could have been trouble shot. The issue is you can not speak to anyone and after all the bs with the chat bot and 'human' I was so frustrated I decided just to send the ring back.Thank goodness I bought it via Amazon because the actual website has no clear cut information on how to return. You have to send an email to the random people that apparently work there. I actually sent an email about my issue with it not syncing and all I received was a transcript of my conversation with the bot.I would love to purchase the Gen 4 ring but with all the trouble just to get something as simple as the ring to sync I couldn't imagine if it broke and you needed to use the warranty.Come on Oura do better.

This wearable ring is absolutely fantastic in what it promises. The metrics for sleep, activity, and a myriad of other health and wellness data pulled are so impressive. More impressive is how they curate and deliver all that data in a simple app view depending on which tab in the app you’re viewing at that time.The 3 stars (insated of 5) is for their black and stealth finishes. They WILL leave spider mark scratches all over your phone screen, appliance handles, car door handle, steering wheel, etc. And they don’t warn customers about this or about wearing these two finishes on the non-dominant hand that doesn’t pull cell phone from pocket/purse or open doors with. Their customer service is very professional but said in vague terms that these two finishes may cause friction scratches.Two recommendations: 1) buy silver finish (I can’t speak for gold) if you want to guarantee no scratches because I tried it or 2) if you absolutely must have black or stealth, always wear it on your non-dominant hand and get your phone a screen protector at the very least and never wear around the house (ie only when outside or sleeping).Hope this helps and once they fix this one flaw, I’d love to give them 5 stars.",https://www.amazon.com/Oura-Ring-Gen3-Sizing-Kit/product-reviews/B0CYWC18G8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1

However, as others have written in their reviews, this is not a good fitness tracker. This is unfortunate, because there are places where Oura has advertised itself as such. There are also really bad issues with syncing fitness data with other apps. The $6 a month service fee they charge is also something that I have concluded is not worth the price. Bottom line: If you're looking for a product that can track fitness, look elsewhere. If you are someone that has relatively good health and sleep, an Oura ring won't be useful. If you are looking to get a handle on sleep problems or with your menstrual cycle, your mileage may vary.More detailed thoughts:-THE OURA RING DOES NOT WORK AS ADVERTISED: Since the Oura ring is an awful pedometer, calorie burn and all-around fitness tracker, you need to be able to incorporate fitness data from other apps (for example, Google Fit). When data syncs from Google Fit to Oura, it incorporates that data for around 3 days. For some mystifying reason that Oura cannot explain beyond ""we're aware of the issue and working on it,"" Oura then discounts all of the synced fitness data (like, it still visible in the app, but the data doesn't count for any of its calculations). It then recalculates all of your ""Readiness,"" ""Activity,"" and ""Resilience"" data. In my case, it then goes from an 'optimum' score to a 'pay attention' score. Essentially, it renders 3 of Oura's 4 main tracking functions useless. This issue occurred for 3 of the 5 months I used the ring. As described earlier, Oura is aware of this issue, they've just done nothing to fix it.-They don't provide much, if any, context for various readings. The only advice they seem to offer for those actually looking to improve their sleep/health/fitness are pre-recorded  'guided meditations' from various providers. I did not find these to be particularly helpful.-They try to manufacture meaning from their readings with their weekly and monthly ""trends."" When you have a relatively consistent lifestyle, the ""trends"" are so small as to be meaningless. For example,  ""You're sleep is trending down"" looks rather silly when the line graph ""trend"" is from 8.25 hrs to 8.2 hrs.-The kicker for me is that the tracker has now even stopped tracking my sleep accurately. It seems like they changed up their algorithms for or something. I have kepy the ring on the same finger, wore it in the same way, but last night's sleep tracking was wildly inaccurate. I woke up feeling refreshed and felt I had a normal sleep, but the Oura app reported that I slept terribly. It was 1/2 hour late detecting my sleep and when it did, it showed I was awake for over an hour longer than I actually was. This was the last straw for me, as the sleep tracking was Oura's only decent function.So, I'm taking the ring off now and cancelling the monthly membership. It's too bad, I had high hopes for this ring. It's why I shelled out $300, plus have been paying a $6 monthly fee. But, buyer beware, unless you really need help tracking your sleep (or possibly your menstrual cycle, I can't speak to that), don't buy an Oura ring.

Those are really the only stats I look at. Battery life is pretty good (mine usually needs charging nearly every 3-4 days).  It’s very stylish and comfortable.

I had wanted this ring since it first came out but could never afford it. Now that you can use your FSA/HSA, it is possible. Since I used mine, I went with my favorite color rose gold. The color itself is gorgeous but not a true rose gold. It’s more of a true gold. Doesn’t matter because it’s beautiful and so functional. I look forward to waking up and checking my stats on the app. It is so accurate too! I thought I was getting a bit sick one day and it told me to take it easy so it picked up on the changes within my body. The sleep tracking is what I mainly got the ring for. I have trouble tossing and turning all night and this ring picks up on my sleep cycles. It will give suggestions of when you should go to sleep to get a better night’s rest. It is pretty comfortable to sleep with as well. Doesn’t bother me at all.Choosing the right size of ring is very important. Since our fingers do tend to swell in our sleep and with the weather. I recommend sizing up. I usually wear a size 8 but with the sizing kit, I found I had to size up to a 9. Even when my finger has swelled, it’s not uncomfortable at least for me.I have seen a lot of people being put off on the monthly subscription. Although it would be nice not to have to pay for one, I don’t mind it.As far as the work out option, I haven’t gotten a chance to test it. I do feel it needs better options to choose from with the workout options they have. If it were more like the options on my Apple Watch, it would make it even better. I also feel the period tracking could be better. It’s very basic. Just lets you choose a start date and your flow.

I recently got Covid-19. 2 days prior to any symptoms, my Oura app picked up on a change in my usual vitals. At the time I had no idea why because I felt fine. Well, the ring knew I was getting sick before I started to actually feel it. I was able to prepare before by taking it easy. I decided to stockpile some airborne, a neti pot, soup and medicine before I was in bed feeling like crap. For the record the ring did not diagnose me! However, through my resting heart rate being unusually elevated and temperature it notified me by asking if anything had changed.I got tested 3 days after symptoms started to kick in and sure enough I had covid. This ring has helped me to take my health and rest so much more seriously.Battery life: I usually recharge every 4 days while I shower and get ready. It takes about 30 min- 1 hour to completely charge depending on how low the charge is. I’ve only ever let it completely die once.Color: I have mixed feeling about the color. It’s got more of a stainless steel /krome/mirrory look than silver. Silver tends to be lighter or brighter that stainless steel. It’s gotten a ton of scratches as with any piece of hand jewelry. I think the scratches add character and don’t mind them at all. The scratches and wear have not changed the color of my ring at all which is something I’ve seen in other reviews for the black and gold varieties. If I had the money to splurge I would get one in every color.Natural cycles: I have a subscription with NC. You do have to go in at least 1x week to sync all the basal body temps. At first I thought I would forget to do this. Once I started to look at all my statistics, I was so into it, that it became second nature to just look in the app. I love seeing notifications from my Oura app and my Natural cycles app. It keeps me off instagram.Cheaper version from TikTok: I got the TikTok ring to compare and honestly the Oura app has so much more to offer in comparison.

Cycle Insights / Natural cycle- Ladies this one is for you if you are looking to come off hormonal birth control and/or looking to start a family or if you’re honestly just curious. I will say the more data that you provide the app on your last 6 periods the better it has predicting (but no worries if you don’t know it) will talk about the natural cycles app in a few. This will take your body temperature every day and create a graph, when you download the natural cycles app (which btw pairs wonderfully with the Oura ring) every morning you will open up the Oura ring app and allow everything to sync then it will transfer that data to your natural cycles app. There you will have Green Day’s ( your safe days for s*x), and red days when it’s not safe (unless looking to start a family I’m sure yours will be very different from mine). This will predict days of ovulation based on your body temp. And your est. next cycle. You will then fill out this form it will ask you if you’ve had s*x, bleeding (for period), LH test, ovulation symptoms and your overall “how are you feeling”. The more information you give the app the better.5. Your Readiness Score - basically everything I talked about sleep, HR, temperature, “activity” even though I don’t use it. I put my Apple Watch information into it” your stress, this calculates everything and gives you a readiness score to take on your day. It may give you advice to relax, call you out on your drinking “hey your HR was elevated did you consume alcohol or have a late light snack” sometimes it can tell you that you might be coming down with something, or that you can take the day on.I will say there are CONS— it’s a wellness ring, not a fitness ring. The app…… it’s $5.99 a month… for a ring that you pay $350 based on the ring and finish. Kind of annoying. This does scuff pretty easy (so if you wear this while working out get a ring protector).However the Pro’s outweigh the cons…. I’m able to learn a lot about my sleep I’ve got some PTSD/ insomnia from the military. I’ve been able to learn a lot about my stress and period tracking. I think this was very much worth the purchase (I did hold off for a year).",https://www.amazon.com/Oura-Ring-Gen3-Sizing-Kit/product-reviews/B0CYWC18G8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1

Unknown,R3ED0R4VCG7DP7,Positive,"Sony ULT Field 1 Wireless Speaker Compact and Portable Design, Enhanced Bass and Sound Diffusion, Long-Lasting Battery Life, Waterproof Shower Speaker with Bluetooth SRSULT10W, Off White",4.6,5.0,581,"I was in need of a new versatile portable speaker to fit my summer adventures; one that was portable enough to fit in a beach bag and left in my car or to play out in my pool area that packed a punch in sound. After a week of owning this speaker, all in all it has checked every box.TLDR: This speaker, while a tiny bit smaller than what I was expecting, packs amazing sound quality from a trusted brand to easily liven up any outdoor occasion. Their app is great for EQ settings, however the physical ULT button provided great boost to your music by itself to hype up any outdoor event. Waterproofing is great and holds a good charge while being extremely portable with its carrying strap.Packaging:- The speaker arrived in a regular cardboard box. While it was nice to see Sony turn to the newer trend of making packaging as recyclable as possible, I did notice that the pieces holding the speaker were flimsy and could possibly be a concern during delivery. However, mine thankfully arrived in perfect condition. Included inside the box was the speaker itself with the carrying band already attached, a USB A to USB C charging cable, and a very small paper pamphlet. Instructions for the speaker are found through a scanned QR code within this pamphlet which allowed for more information about the speaker to be addressed.Sound Quality:- As to no surprise from this being from Sony, this speaker sounds amazing. It doesn’t get tinny at higher volumes, the dual drivers create amazing bass, and overall it covers all genres with no issue presenting truly enjoyable melodies for all music. At max volume, while the speaker does not get deafening loud if you are outdoors (indoors it possibly will depending on what you define as deafening lol), it certain gets loud enough to entertain a large area. In my 40 foot by 120 foot patio, this speaker shined and was the center piece of great sound quality and entertainment. While it certain suits my needs for loudness, you can always take it a notch up by either using the ULT button or pairing it with a second ULT Field 1 and working them in stereo (both discussed in features).Features:- This speaker is packed with all of the expected features of a modern Bluetooth speaker. It quickly connects to remembered devices when powered on (one nice little note: to power on/off this device, only a single press of the power button is needed for each. While a small detail, it truly is something that is appreciated for ease of use) and has a great battery life. While I cannot speak for the full I’ve gone 6 hours of using the speaker which left it at 50%, so I believe their claim of 12 hours of battery life to be true. This speaker also has a quick charger feature of 10 mins of charging for 3 hours of playback. I haven’t tested that myself as of yet, but I have other newer Song products with similar fast charging features and their claims for those products have not fallen short, so I believe these ones as well.- There is also a Bluetooth pairing button, a multiple use button that can play/pause tracks, skip/reverse tracks, and answer/hang up phone calls depending on need. Functionality was clearly a forethought of this speaker, since this button’s commands—while certainly vast—are greatly designed. Play/pause is a single press, skip is a double press, reverse is a triple press, and it converts to a call answer/hang up button with a single press functionality when you receive a call. There are also independent volume up/down buttons which increase the volume by a decent percentage in each press.- Then there is the ULT button, which is a built in EQ adjustment presented as a physical button on the speaker. It comes with default settings when pressed that noticeably enhance the all around sound quality of any melody, with an emphasis on bass and treble. The EQ for the ULT button can be adjusted in the Sony Music Center app. It’s a great feature to use when you want to give that extra boost to your music.- While I have not tried it myself, this speaker also has the ability to be set in stereo with a second ULT speaker, and I’m sure the dual speaker combination could easily work as a stereo set up for any venue needs.- The waterproofing of this speaker is on par with expectations. I’ve taken it to many water-based areas and have gotten it splashed with water and it’s been completely fine. The USB C charging port is covered with a water tight seal that you can open and close easily.- This speaker works with Sony’s music center app, and while it’s a bit rougher than their headphone app, it still works wonderfully to optimize the speaker’s functionality and performance. Full EQ settings are available, along with specific battery percentage, updates, and settings for the speaker.- The included carrying strap is a nice touch that, I will admit I did not initially think I was going to like, however it very quickly grew on me and I find myself carrying the speaker solely by the strap anywhere I take it. It is tied onto the speaker and can be removed, however you will have to re-tie it yourself if you want to reattach it.Build Quality:- Once again, as expected from this price point and the Song brand, this is truly a high quality speaker. It feels great to hold, with the fabric being sturdy and made of soft material. The buttons are covered in strong rubber that give a satisfying response when pushed. The carrying strap is thick and made of a high quality and very slightly elastic material. You are certainly getting your money’s worth on quality alone, which is what I expect from the Song brand.Final Thoughts:- While it is certainly understandable to hesitant when looking at a $120 Bluetooth speaker, this one truly is worth its value. I have very little complaints with this speaker, and think that it’s a great edition to anyone’s outdoor entertainment experience. The ULT button is a feature I find myself using more than expected (in a good way) to help boost my music during gatherings to help the entertainment. With its waterproofing, I feel comfortable using it as a travel speaker to any destination I plan on visiting. This feature packed speaker is truly one of a kind, and I’m certainly satisfied with my purchase.",https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Bluetooth-Waterproof-Shockproof-Detachable/product-reviews/B0CXKV7WMJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1
Unknown,R18S17G392OP4Q,Positive,"Sony ULT Field 1 Wireless Speaker Compact and Portable Design, Enhanced Bass and Sound Diffusion, Long-Lasting Battery Life, Waterproof Shower Speaker with Bluetooth SRSULT10W, Off White",4.6,5.0,581,"We were on the market for a bluetooth portable speaker for our 18 year old daughter as a birthday present.  We normally gravitate to the JBL brand - which ARE, and still remain to be, great speakers.  But, being the baby of the family and living with hand-me-down [you name it]s all her life, I knew she'd appreciate a speaker in a style that was totally her own -- not another one of mom and dad's (or big brother's) speakers.  Fun and easy as that sounds, this meant stepping out of my comfort zone.  (You know how it is: you like what you like!)  So I REALLY did my homework by researching many different brands/styles/specs (Bose, Beats, etc.) of speakers in the (about $100-150) price range.  The number one thing our daughter was asking for was portability - hesitantly saying nothing bigger than her brother's JBL Charge 4, but I could tell smaller would be better.  Bigger speakers may give better sound, but she wanted a ""water bottle speaker"" as they're called because they fit nicely in cup holders.  So I began my search by comparing models to JBL's Flip 6 - the one I was originally going to purchase.  I came across this Sony ULT Field 1, which is a new model that Sony released just a few months ago. I was impressed by it's veratility.  Built the same way as the Flip 6 (outward facing woofer and tweeter, side bass) it has many of the same features as the Flip 6 like an app with an equalizer so you can fine tune your music and 12 hours of battery life.  But the Field 1 came with a few extra features that raised my eyebrow...  A ULT bassboost button giving you an extra, little option: go with a deeper bass if you're dancin' the night away - or turn it off if you're, say, talking with friends around a campfire and save on battery life. (By the way, it sounds GREAT even with it off!)  It also  comes with a phyical pause button and voice feature  - where you can answer the phone through the speaker, (like in your car).  Although it IS bigger than the Flip 6 it is smaller than the JBL Charge 5 - the newer version of her brother's speaker.  As far as sound quality, several reviewers (YouTube) stated that the Field 1's sound quality falls BETWEEN JBL's Flip 6 and Charge 5 models.  (I used my headphones to listen while they demonstrated the different speakers' sounds and, yes... uh-huh... I agree.)  Again, ALL 3 speakers have very, VERY good sound quality - you really can't go wrong with any of them.  We were looking at Sony's ULT Field 1 simply because we wanted to give our daughter something unique to our household - that fit her description of ""bottle speaker"" but measured up to my (ha!) standards of sound quality.  I also want to point out (on a petty note) that we DO LIKE the carrying cord - a feature I thought at first glance might be awkward. It can be removed if desired but lemme tell ya, it's QUITE handy!  :D  So I added it to my cart, did that lil' 'hold-your-breath' pause thing we all do ...then tapped the 'ORDER' button.  It arrived today (very next day) and, wanting to surprise her [a month] early, went ahead and handed her the package.  (Sigh...gone are the days of my elegant gift wrapping sessions.)  The surprise alone tickled her - but when she opened it, her eyes grew WIDE!  She genuinely LOVED it!!  (May I be clear here: I couldve given her a cleaned up, secondhand, garage sale speaker and she, in her sweet-nature, would have ""LOVED"" that. Ha! Ha!  It was a sweet treat to do this for her.) 😄🥲I asked if the size was too big and she said it was very much OK!  Now, my picky ears are truly impressed by it's CLEAR sound - even turned ALL the way up, there's no ""fuzziness"" here!  I had chosen the white color and it's very nice. It's not a sporty, bright white - just kind of a classy, muted off-white.  One thing I DO like over the JBL brand is that the buttons have little, lights by each one  so they'll be more easily seen in the evenings. (Cool!😎) Connectivity was easy - or so I assume.  She had it out if the box and connected to her iPhone faster than I could say ""Wait; there's an app..."".  She was already downloading the app and was playing music as I sat at down at the table to look it all over.  So I'm feeling pretty confident to say it's easy to set up.  As far as fitting in the cup holder, it does fit...kind of. It sits about 2½ inches down  - snuggly enough to keep it securely upright while driving, but not all the way seated down inside it.  Our car's cupholders (Ford Escape) have these little spring loaded, retractable, grabber things that prevent it from being seated all the way down inside.  Bump it with your elbow and it'll go flying.  That said, it still may fit in YOUR cupholders.It definitely will fit the (Ford) truck's cupholders. Lol!She loved the speaker so much though, it wasn't a deal breaker!After all that - go figure!  (RME)  But, hey!...that just tells you how good this speaker is!!)  Overall, it is very much a sweet little speaker for its size and price point!  (Way to go, Sony!)

Unknown,R1CMFWUKND8EM,Positive,"Sony ULT Field 1 Wireless Speaker Compact and Portable Design, Enhanced Bass and Sound Diffusion, Long-Lasting Battery Life, Waterproof Shower Speaker with Bluetooth SRSULT10W, Off White",4.6,5.0,581,"This little speaker surprised me. This “ULT” button packs a punch, but not in the way you would think. Most of my past speakers with a boost button basically increased bass. It’s fine if that’s all you want, but the equalization isn’t there. The bass over-powers the voice or the other instruments. This ULT button gives you more bass - check , and the other sounds also get enhanced. It’s pretty remarkable. The strap is cool. I can hang it from the table umbrella in my back yard. Porting the side speakers was smart. You can use it horizontal like normal or when you stand it vertically, the bottom speaker isn’t fully covered. The air can go somewhere. I think Sony has a winner here. This is definitely coming pool side and beach side on our next trip to FLA. I got the white color. Looks good. I’m glad I picked this one. It’s definitely a keeper.Oh, all the other good stuff. Easy to connect to iPhone. 12 hour battery is very good for me and small for its power. Also works as a speaker phone and all the proofs.

Unknown,RJFBE7W2A9HWL,Positive,"Sony ULT Field 1 Wireless Speaker Compact and Portable Design, Enhanced Bass and Sound Diffusion, Long-Lasting Battery Life, Waterproof Shower Speaker with Bluetooth SRSULT10W, Off White",4.6,5.0,581,"What I was looking for was a compact bluetooth speaker that packs a punch in bass, so I decided to give this Sony speaker a try and boy was I surprised by it! 1. Bluetooth pairing - First, pairing this was super easy. I happen to have an Android phone and once bluetooth is on, it automatically pops up on my phone and asks if I want to pair it.2.  Design - for a compact size speaker, it is really lightweight and because the speaker is shaped the way it is, it can easily stand up by itself or laid out sideways. The tether that comes with it can easily be strapped on to my backpack or a bicycle.3. Bass - The sound varies depending on the position of the speaker, but the bass is surprisingly good! The secret here is the ""ult"" button. Once you press that, it really amps up the bass while not sacrificing the clarity of the vocals. What I thought was cool was the companion app that you can use to control the speaker in which you can also customize the sound through the equalizer. I am not too picky when it comes to sound, but the opportunity to customize it will be super flexible for those who like their own sound.4. Sound Quality and Distance - This to me was the main reason why I am giving it 5 stars. The sound quality has really good range from the low tones to the high tones. I like to listen to the variety of different styles of music and I am very impressed of the sound reproduction of this speaker. Usually, I am not too far away from the speaker, but there had been times where I had to go downstairs to do something and what's nice is that the speaker had really good range for a bluetooth speaker. The sound never cut out once. As a bonus, what I discovered in the app, was an option to either turn on sound quality performance or focus on a stable connection and I think that will allow some people to really enjoy their music even from a far away distance.5. Price - $128 is still a lot of money, but for this amount of money and what I am getting from this speaker. I say it is well worth it because I can take this literally anywhere outside or inside. There have been a couple of times when my phone was paired to the speaker and somebody called in and I had a conversation with them not knowing I can actually talk to them from the speaker! So yes, if you can afford this speaker, I say give this a try!

My Go-to was always the JBL flip series, as i right now own the flip 6.Design: The utility here is great, it has a carry strap that doubles as a hanger, or a handle!, the build is very rugged and high quality, i would not baby this thing at all, it handles its own!Sound & Performance: Out of the box the speaker comes with ULT on, and WOAH!, it gets very loud for its size!. This speaker connects to sony’s music center app, where you can customize the eq, connect in stereo to another field 1, and many other settings!. The sound is very open, clear on vocals ,it fills up a big room really well and maps the sound out. A really great sounding speaker. Battery life is really good,it varies how you use it, but real world use ( 50-80% volume, ULT on) its good for 8-10 hours straight. It does take a while to charge, about 5 hours if its completely drained. But thats good for the overall life of the battery.Compared to JBL flip 6: Ive been back forth between these two for the past couple days. And i found myself reaching for the field 1! It sounds better, its more open, it sounds like the music fills up any room, as for the JBL, it targets the sound directly at you, and the highs are a bit harsh, sony simply just outperforms it!Value: at retail ($128). I would buy this speaker no question. Its great and performs as well as speakers above its weight class.On sale : $98, i would buy it IMMEDIATELY:), insane value.",https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Bluetooth-Waterproof-Shockproof-Detachable/product-reviews/B0CXKV7WMJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1

My teenage son has always been a hard sell on design. He was sold. The shiny Sony logo caught his attention immediately.I was surprise on the sound quality. This is me speaking from comparing to a different Sony speaker I've owned in the past (xb23 is the model number, I think).The ""cool factors"" for me were: 1. push the ULT button to enhance the bass and clear highs that really bring out the music while hanging out in the backyard. 2. Strap - It allows me to hang the speaker on the patio umbrella and out of the way of things (see pic). 3. Setting it up was a breeze. Wifey opened up the box, push the power button, paired the bluetooth, all on her own. Lastly, what really stood out to me was how well-built this speaker is. It feels sturdy and durable, but it's lightweight enough to take with me wherever I go. Plus, the sleek design looks great.Haven't had it long enough to noticed any ""cons"" about this speaker. If I were to say something, I'd say price. I purchased the speaker at regular price because I needed a second unit for our backyard.

It also has the option of adding base at the touch of a button for when you are listening to music rather than a podcast. The Sony ULT went on sale, so I bought it and have to agree that it has the perfect balance for a speaker of this size.

The date displayed is when the pics were sent to the frame rather than when pic was taken which messes up the chronological order on slideshow display and the headings on photos don't carry over to all 10 pics marked & therefore have to be typed with each photo.

Thats the reason I still have it. Almost gave it up because of the app and user friendliness. I think it’s not at all user friendly and app is just wierd. Uploading photos took me a while to figure out esp to create diff albums. It also repeats photos from one upload lot a million times before it switches to another upload lot since I uploaded photos in batches multiple times as we keep adding. Also since I didn’t want to give access to all my photos it’s more complicated. I wish they would use some other app for uploading the photos on this frame. Deleting photos shows as “revoke access” and they still show in the app history which makes me think it’s saved with the app server even after deleting them and not completely deleted. Hopefully the data is not used with third party. Apart from the app I think the frame is good.

I keep it below 6 sheets of paper and I make sure that any stickiness is covered when shredding and the instructions are clear ""NO SHREDDING MEDAL"". this is common in any shredders I have ever owned and if you want to shred medal all day and 50 pieces of paper then you need to buy the thousand-dollar product.

It was a heavy machine that sat atop a plastic basket and needed a good fit for the “actuating pin” to sit on this plastic receptacle bin. Over time, the weight of that shredder had cracked the bin and made everything unusable. No replacement for the bin available and superglue and duck tape just wasn’t working.I considered a new shredder that had a pull out bin, but after analyzing how much use (including number of sheets to feed into the machine at one time), cost, and overall weight of the machine, I realized a lightweight shredder might meet my needs. Good decision on my part.Excellent aspects:It is very lightweight machine that has an excellent and comfortable folding handle to lift it off the included basket. I have serious arthritis in both wrists and most fingers, and I can lift this off without any issues at all. It also easily seats right back into the correct position without any problems when put back onto the receptacle bin.It is pretty quiet when running.It has a window that clearly tells you when the bin is getting full, ensuring that you do not overfill and jam the machine. When full, the bin is easy to lift and dump its shredded pieces into  a larger trash bag. The pieces may get a little statically attached to the plastic bin, so try covering the opening of the bin with a trash bag before you invert the bin and then tap the aides of the bin to get all the shredded pieces into the trash bag. I still had to round up some “shred debris” that clung to the inside of basket or missed the bag…not big deal.Price was awesome!Average/neutral aspects:My previous shredder had a lock out mechanism that let me ensure the shredder could not be accidentally turned on if the main selector switch was unintentionally moved to the “on” position. This machine does not have such a feature. It has 4 positions: FWD (on with continuous shredder wheels engaged regardless of whether something is sensed in the shredder slot), AUTO (power on, but shredder wheels not engaged unless something is sensed in the shredder slot), REV (shredder wheels in constant motion, but pushing things back out of the feeder slot), and OFF (which powers down the machine, red power light goes off). As there is no “guard switch” to prevent accidental activation, I simply unplugged it when I am not using it for a time and if any small children/pets are around.It also has an overheat light if the motor os getting too hot from continuous or heavy load use.It is not top heavy, but still can be tipped over if you move or bump against it. I have it freestanding on the floor between a similar sized trash can and the side of my desk. I have had no problems with it tipping or moving during use.There is a credit card slot, and while the machine will “chew” these up, you can hear the machine slow and even see the credit card wobble as it is being shredded. Worked OK as I only shred a card or two annually.I would not place more than 3-4 sheets of regular paper in at one time as you can hear the machine slowing to shred that amount. I am sure it can do more, but I decided to simply be cautious. The machine does shred as quickly as most residential use machines, however.Note: The actual continuous run time on this machine is much better than advertised. I ran it for 10 minutes without any problems, although I was only inserting 1-2 sheets at a time, not the max they say you can at a time. No overheat light came one, albeit the top of the machine did become a little warm.Overall, very happy with this machine. It will only get used every couple of weeks and then for only about 15-20 sheets of paper or other junk ail (credit card mailings, credit card receipts, etc…",https://www.amazon.com/Shredder-Crosscut-Document-Wastebasket-C237-B/product-reviews/B0CPDFYYJK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1

I recently found myself needing one in a situation where I was aligning a vintage audio tape recorder. To do this, I needed a signal generator to produce specific audio frequencies for testing and calibration. I didn’t have a dedicated signal generator but found an iPhone app that could accomplish the task. But my tape recorder, which was manufactured decades before bluetooth audio was conceived, required audio input through its RCA stereo jacks.That’s when I ordered this product. It works exactly as advertised, connecting easily to the iPhone’s Lightning port and delivering analog audio via a (formerly) standard 1/8"" stereo TRS jack. Et, voila! I now had my signal generator connected directly to the tape recorder.The nylon-braided cable seems quite durable, and I expect it will serve me for many years to come. At two cables per order, this represents a fine value. I can recommend this product without hesitation to anyone needing analog audio output from a late-model iPhone.",https://www.amazon.com/iPhone-Headphone-Stereo-Speaker-Compatible/product-reviews/B0D49CQ2GB/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1

I received the charger with 3 dots already showing as charged (75% of the battery or 22,000 mAh) .  I charged my phone from about 23% to 100%.  My phone has a 3140 mAh battery size.  Charging my phone from 23% to 100% used up 2 of the 3 dots (capacity 15,000 mAh) on the battery pack.  Now, I'm no electrical engineer but if the battery had 30,000 mAh then 2 dots (what was used up) would be 15,000 mAh.  So, there is no way that this battery bank has a 30,000 mAh capacity. Even if it only transferred the charge at 50% then it should still have only used up 1/4 of the battery, not 1/2.Edit: Further testing of the capacity of this battery bank... I fully charged the battery and charged my Garmin mini and my phone. At full charge ( 4 dots) of the battery bank it charged my Garmin mini (1250 mAh) from 23% to 100%. Then it charged my phone ( 3140 mAh) from 25% to 65% before it was fully discharged.  So the full battery capacity was only able to charge 2222 mAh.  That is not even close to 30,000 mAh that this is supposed to have.Edit:  The solar charging is actually working.  I had it in the sun from sun up, (about 6:30am)  to sundown (about 8:30 pm) and it added one dot (25% of it's capacity) to the battery pack.  I'm not sure how  this is going to work when I'm hiking because it's not really possible to have the unit directed at the sun for the entire day.  Edit.  After 2.5 full days of full sun and managing the battery so that it was always facing the sun, I was only able to add 50% of this battery's capacity (from one dot to three dots).Final: I returned this. If it would have had at least the 30,000 battery bank capacity as advertised I would have kept it but the low battery capacity and the slow charging, this wasn't worth any money.

A few months ago, the wireless charging pad stopped working - tried several phones and nothing. Also, the USB-C charger cord stopped working right after that probably because the wire inside broke. It still holds a large charge and can use it to recharge a phone 4x or 5x as well as my laptop and tablet 1x or 2x. The solar charging takes forever now.I would NOT buy this again. Chargers are getting smaller and better than this one.Original review (was 5 star):Just got the battery pack and tested all the features out. It was already pre-charged to 3/4 bars.1- Solar charging. As I unboxed it in the car, it was blinking (charging) from the sun coming in from the windshield. Check.2 - I plugged it into the wall charger with a micro USB cord then a USB c cord and it charged. Check.3 - recharged a 2500 mah phone twice by itself. Took about an hour each time without using my own non-fast charging cord. Check.4 - Placed two wireless charging phones on it and that worked. Its wireless charging is easier and faster to use than my other wireless charging pad. Check.5 - Maxxed the output by charging 4 devices at one time (and also using the wireless charging) and that's what finally depleted the remaining charge on the battery pack. Check.6 - Don't really need the lights, but they work as described. Check.I estimate the total output actually received by my devices was somewhere just below 30K mah - which is probably due to energy loss in transfer. Also maxxing out by charging multiple devices wastes extra mAh than charging just one device at a time.Pros - It works! It can be charged multiple ways. It has passthrough charging - while it's charging, you can still use it to charge another device. It can fit into an avg size purse and definitely a backpack. Has micro usb, USB c, and has lightning charging cables attached so you're ready no matter what mobile device you need to charge. You can charge multiple devices at a time. Will even receive solar charge while charging a wireless device when that device is placed UNDER the charger with charger's solar side facing up.Cons - This thing is heavy like a brick - 1.3lbs . It will NOT fit into your pocket. It doesn't come with a cover so the attached charging cords can flip out. (I will make a Velcro cover). The attached cords are thin so may not last long. The whole unit should come with a protective cover to keep dust out of the charging cord plugs and to prevent scratches to the solar panel. I always put something beneath it before placing the panel side down on any surface.Also - as with all solar offerings, solar panels can only do so much charging. This unit does not solar charge indoors when it's cloudy outside and only in a bright sunny window or under a bright light. The surface area and capacity of the cells is small, so it will take a while (several days at least) to get a full charge. And with other solar chargers, a trickle charge dissipates while getting a solar charge. Don't expect miracles, but do charge it up fully by plug (takes about 8hrs) and use solar charging as a top up measure.Also as seller states, don't leave it in a car or other possible extreme temperatures to protect the battery. And whatever you do - DON'T ever drop it and expect it to work correctly again. Its weight will cause damage on impact. I dropped one of those portable car battery chargers and after that the charger battery pack started swelling and I had to dispose of it. Never use a swelling or damaged battery pack. They can and do EXPLODE.I'm going to expand the solar surface area with a DIY aluminum foil box which will reflect more light into the panel for faster charging.But loving it so far.",https://www.amazon.com/Solar-Charger-Power-Bank-Charging/product-reviews/B0DFC9CXRW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1

Thankfully, I haven't had much reason to test it out, until I went camping for a week in Colorado last week. Before heading out, I made sure it was fully charged, which as some have said, does take a minute. I was able to charge my Galaxy S23 Ultra twice, from about 20% to 100%, and my small Amazon Fire tablet twice from about 50% to full. The charger was still just under halfway depleted after all that. This is such a luxury, and a huge upgrade from the portable charger I've been dealing with for the last several years. The flashlight came in handy for trudging from the tent to the bathroom at night. The only drawback for me is that it apparently doesn't have enough output to charge my Surface 7 Pro tablet, which can charge via USB-C as well as the proprietary magnetic charging connection that I usually use. To be fair, the only USB-C charger in my house that will do it is the 45W charger that I use to rapid-charge my Galaxy.

It's done everything I've wanted to and more!It comes with 3 charging cables for different phone types. I've only used the USB-C and iPhone cables myself, but I assume the micro-USB cable works great too. The wireless charging pad is also quite handy, although it won't charge your phone as quickly as the cables will (which is to be expected).You can charge the device 3 different ways. There's a USB-A and USB-C port and either one can charge the device. To charge it from zero to 100% will take a several hours, but considering the battery size that's to be expected. The 3rd way to charge it is with the solar panel on the front of the device. This is a great feature to have, but it does come with a couple of caveats.Firstly, even if you place the device in direct sunlight on a summer day, the solar charging is pretty slow. It's a small solar panel that can only absorb so much energy at once. So I wouldn't rely on it solely to charge your device while you are on a trip. But if you want to give the battery a little boost while you're outside, it can only help.Second, although it's clearly meant to be in direct sunlight, be careful it doesn't overheat. One time while on a road trip I left it on the dashboard of my car in the sunlight to charge. When I got back to the car later and picked up the charger, it was HOT. I couldn't even hold it for more than a few seconds at a time without burning my hands. I tried turning it on but I couldn't get it to respond. I was worried for a while that I had fried it. But after it cooled down I was able to get it working and it's been fine ever since. But I'm always careful now to not let it get too hot.The battery life on the device is better than I could have hoped for. I can charge my phone from 0-100% 3 or 4 times on one charge. It has fast charging ability and I'm always impressed with how quickly it works. As I stated before, the charging pad isn't as quick, but it's handy if you don't want to plug in.A nice little bonus feature about this charger is the flashlight. It has a strobe light option as well as an SOS morse code feature. I haven't really needed either one (thankfully), but the regular flashlight has come in handy. I went backpacking recently and we were off the grid, hiking through the woods with no trails. We didn't reach our destination before it got dark, and it got DARK. Pitch black, couldn't see a thing. I pulled out the charger and used the flashlight to get us the rest of the way to our campsite.

Being there were no amenities ( electricity, cell service ) on the river, I needed to keep my iPhone charged for the purpose of taking photographs. Unfortunately, I soon discovered that during the most favorable daylight hours, I could not securely attach the device on the Dory boat as we ran the tumultuous Colorado River. Prior to my trip, I did test the solar capacity and discovered that it was very slow to charge and never did completely charge with solar energy. Minus 1 star for that.I was successful at charging the device electrically in my home and from a large battery on the mother ship while on the river. This charge adequately charged my phone ~ 6 times before the device itself needed to be recharged. I was pleased with that performance.The solar charger is well made and waterproof (never challenged that). Weighs about 1# and compact for packing. The 3 different charging cables are a great features as well as the 3 different ports for charging the device. Overall, I would purchase this product again.",https://www.amazon.com/Solar-Charger-Power-Bank-Charging/product-reviews/B0DFC9CXRW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1

LICORNEPros: On the bottom, it comes with 3 short, undetachable common cables for charging phones/devices (Lightning, USB-C, micro USB), then additionally a wireless charger to just set your phone on.  I like that I don't have to find or carry an additional cables just to charge those devices.  It's heavy, but that comes with power it provides.  On the top is a solar shield that assists in charging if you set it in sunlight.  However, you do need to charge it with a power adapter and cable (not supplied).  I use my phone charger and USB-C cable.  Another bonus is the built-in 2-LED lights on one end with 3 different modes.  On the other end is a port cover with 3 ports: a USB 3.0, Micro USB and USB-C.  There is a red power LED on the bottom and 4 blue charge state LEDs on the top.  If you are solar charging, that * LED turns green.  This charger is fantastic for those times you get in a hurry and forget to charge your phone/device or you're out where there's no electricity and you need a bit of power or light.  It's a well made design and it looks good too. They say it's water proof, but I don't intend on tossing it in water.  The water proof might be for times you are hiking or camping and it rains.  It's easy to hold on to and does grip is you set it on a slanted, flat object, with solar facing up.  At just less than $40 it's a great tool to own!Cons:  None so far.At 30000+ mah it believe it's a must have for active people or emergency situations.  Hence, you got to keep it charged for it to be a useful tool.  I keep mine charged, hanging from my go bag.

Unknown,R2E4MN5TSUK0KB,Positive,"Solar Charger Power Bank Fast Charging - 30000mAh Portable Solar Phone Battery Panel Charger, QC3.0 Dual USB Port Battery Pack Charger for All Cell Phones & Electronic Devices (Orange)",4.3,5.0,"7,980","This portable battery pack was everything we could have hoped for, albeit with one minor issue (I’ll explain shortly.) I’ll preface this review by stating we previously purchased a couple of other solar-rechargeable battery packs, neither of which met our expectations. One of the products, while lightweight, required four full days of DIRECT sunlight to achieve a full charge. Anything less than direct sunlight and the pack failed to hold a significant charge. The other pack held a solid charge for a few days, but it was a bit on the heavy side and after a drop of roughly two feet it barely held a charge and eventually stopped working.As for the LICORNE 36800mAh solar power bank, it met all our needs over a week-long hiking trip in Patagonia. We needed only the lightning cable for our iPhones and the USB port for charging our Garmin watches, and occasionally we used the flashlight feature. Taking so many photos with our phones required they be charged every night, as did my wife’s watch (it doesn’t hold a charge like it used to.) We were able to charge those devices every night, and we did so on a single charge of the battery pack (it was fully charged prior to departing for the trek.)The only issue of any concern is the weight of the battery pack. By far the heaviest of the three battery packs we’ve tried, it definitely is something to consider when hiking, especially with a full backpack over uneven, hilly terrain (as experienced in Patagonia). That said, we recognize the weight is a trade-off between its other qualities, including the long battery life, the bright flashlight, the device charging options (via multiple cables and the USB port), and the product sturdiness. And, let’s face it, if you want a battery pack that will carry a substantial charge over several days, you have to expect it to be somewhat heavy.The pros far outweigh the one issue we experienced, but that issue is not enough to rate this product anything less than five stars.",https://www.amazon.com/Solar-Charger-Power-Bank-Charging/product-reviews/B0DFC9CXRW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1

For the intellectual people who are willing to commit to reading more than a sentence this reveiw is for you. Okay now that, that is out of the way lets begin.So this product is around $70 which is a hefty price for a hands free headset. ""Is the price worth it?"" I can hear you asking; and the answer may suprise you.QUALITYLets start with the quality of the bluetooth. I've had the headset for about two to three days now and they have only studdered on me ONCE. You heard that righ, ONCE. It stopped the audio for one second and then went back to playing the audio flawlessly again so its bluetooth conection is really good.BATTERYThe battery life for the headest is also incredible as it hasn't even run low on power; still sitting on 40% or more after a 10 hour work day. So yes its quite impressive. The cord is unique to it however so try not to lose or break it, but even if you do the warranty for cover it. I belive it comes with a life time warranty but you should double check to be sure.MATERIALSo the headset is VERY sturdy, packing over the ear rubber hooks for support. Don't ever worry about it falling off; I work construction and go up and down ladders as well as duck and twist my body in werid angles all the time and it doesn't even budge. I also sweat like a hog all the time and their fine so I'd say their pretty water/sweat RESISTANT. There are only three buttons so the controls are very simple. The only thing complicated could be remembering the button imputs like double tap and holding it briefly.UNIQUE FEATURESOne thing I saw that stood out to me was that even with a hands free headset most cannot handle multiple calls without pulling out your phone but this headset can actually HOLD a call and SWITCH TO THE OTHER CALL and then back to the call that was on hold. Its VERY impressive for a hands free headset and would HIGHLY recomend you give it a try.NEGATIVESThere are two downsides to the product being that it's almost $70 and that the plastic rests on your inner earlobe and can cause it to become sore. The price is steep for a headset BUT if you're not on a tight budget and are looking for a headset for your job then you should REALLY try this.Overall the product is very good. A little pricy, but very good quality and can do things that other headsets can't.",https://www.amazon.com/Gixxted-Headphones-Bluetooth-Microphone-Cancelling/product-reviews/B0CZ42J4JW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1

I use this about 9 hours per day, and have been for the last 6 days. The speaker clarity is perfect and when compared to my old high-end jabra headset, you can't notice a different in sound quality. The noise cancelling capability also works great! I work from home and have my TV on in the background almost the entire day as well as two smaller dogs. I have asked several times on calls if they could hear the background noise and they aside from some barking when someone knocked on my door, they were able to block all other background noises.Product Quality: In terms of quality, these are super light-weight, much lighter than my old expensive headset, and much more comfortable to wear.Battery Life: I have not hit any low battery message or had the battery die in the nine hours I have used these on average per day. Each day after working I put the headset back on the charger.Recommendations: I know all lithium ion batteries will degrade over time, I wish that this came with either a 4 foot or 6 foot charge cable, especially where it isn't a standard USBC or other standard port.

This might be fine if it's right there next to you, but with our son's desk setup up, it was on the bookshelf above, meaning he has to stand and reach and do it with two hands.  Just too inconvenient.

Jabra has a nice solid charging case and I don't have to worry about fumbling with battery changes. (My old hands and small objects do not work well together.)

I didn't realize I couldn't hear birds until I played back a video I took one morning when I thought there was no sound. I was very aware that I could not clearly understand what people said and had to keep asking them to repeat or speak louder. This gets bothersome quickly for both parties.

They're good enough for the price.  But let's talk about the absolute state of this trainwreck of a case (because I have nothing better to do and need to vent).I keep my earbud case plugged into my laptop on my work desk.  I like a clean desk.  So, personally, I like to my earbud case sitting upright instead of just lobbed to the side like an afterthought.  But can you sit this case upright?  No, because the designers thought a rounded bottom would be perfect for this case, meaning it literally can't stand up.  And even if it did have a flat bottom, these geniuses also thought, ""You know what, a charging port on the bottom of the case makes sense.""So the case has to rest on its side.  Fine.  At least, from there, the case can be logically opened right?  Wrong!  If the case is resting on the side that shows you the indicator light that they're charged, the case opens into your desk, meaning if you're trying to flip it open with one hand, the case will be inclined to shut on you because of gravity.  So the easiest way to open the case is to position it face down on your desk, meaning when you take the earbuds out you have to remember to now reverse them so that they go to the right ear.You have no idea how much I don't want to be writing all of this right now.  I didn't know it was possible to be annoyed so routinely by the design of an earbud case.  What's most annoying is that my spouse also has a pair of Jabra earbuds and her case is designed the correct way that I assumed all earbud cases were designed.  This case somehow managed to screw up every single design choice that I took for granted as a user.Like I said, though:  Audio's okay.",https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-Active-Comfortable-Cancellation/product-reviews/B0CB92Z7V2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=critical&pageNumber=1

Unknown,R2BXID4RAPII1O,Positive,"Jabra Elite 8 Active - Best, Most Advanced HearThrough Sports Wireless Bluetooth Earbuds - Comfortable Secure Fit, Military Grade Durability, Active Noise Cancellation, Dolby Surround Sound - Navy",4,5.0,304,"Every review I read about these said that the 10s were a massive step up from the 8s. Being that I've learned that reviews are 1) very subjective, and 2) tend to push the higher priced/sponsored option, I decided to buy both these and the 10s and experience them for myself.  Here's my experience so far: -Fit- The 8s fit better in my ear than the 10s. Perhaps I should say more snug. I find them both comfortable, but the 8s fit a bit deeper in my ear and feel more secure.  The 10s have a triangular shaped ear tip, so finding the right tip size to get them to seal properly for ANC.  The 8s have a more standard style ear tip, so it's easier to get a seal for me.  The one downside is that there is ever so slightly more of that occlusion effect where it feels like you have something plugging your ears, but its very, very minor compared to my older 75ts.  I regularly worried about the 10s falling out, although they never did.  I never once worried about the 8s, and I knew they were secure always. - Sound - I'll acknowledge that the 10s sound a bit brighter, but they didn't have the same low end fullness that I like in the music that I listen to, that is until I tried the different ear tip sizes.  I found that the 10s were a bit more shrill on the high end, even after I EQ'd them.  The EQ certainly helped.  The 8s had fullness without the harshness, though weren't quite as detailed.  Listening to them side by side, I can certainly say that I heard just a bit more detail in the 10s, but it wasn't such a difference that it felt like a revelation like most of the big reviews were saying.  I could FEEL the music more in the 8s than I could in the 10s.  The 10s may be technically superior, but I liked the 8s better.  The 10s are closer to the AZ60M2, with a slight edge going to those.-ANC-  This was a weird one for me. Typically, I'm able to use the ear tips that come preinstalled as my ear tip size of choice.  With the 8s, I had no problem out of the box.  The ANC was very solid, and actually was among the best I've personally tried (Airpods Pro 2 are still the top dog here IMO, and I have no intention of buying the Sony XM5s or Bose earbuds, so I cannot compare to those).  Initially, I though the 10s ANC was weak.  Once I changed out the tips though, it was much, MUCH better than I'd initially experienced.  In using them side by side, I'd say the ANC is neck and neck, with a slight edge actually going to the 8s.  I'd read a lot of people claiming that the ANC on the 10s were so much better than the 8s, but that has not been my experience at all.  To my ears, they are almost identical.All in all, I really like these.  I thought the difference would be more significant given the price difference, but to me, they are extremely close. The question you have to ask is whether or not those minor differences are worth the price increase.",https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-Active-Comfortable-Cancellation/product-reviews/B0CB92Z7V2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1

Unknown,R2J4GYKY18A51I,Positive,"Jabra Elite 8 Active - Best, Most Advanced HearThrough Sports Wireless Bluetooth Earbuds - Comfortable Secure Fit, Military Grade Durability, Active Noise Cancellation, Dolby Surround Sound - Navy",4,4.0,304,"Let me start by saying that I am a fan of able. I am both enough of a fan and old enough to not only remember, but actually owned the Apple Newton. So, I really wanted to love the AirPods Pro 2nd Gen. But, like the first gen, no matter what tip I used, they just would not stay in my ear (my left ear was the main problem). You can see from the pictures that I even tried after market memory foam tips, but to no avail. And they would fall out just sitting at my desk, so forget about working out. As such, I had purchased a pair of Bose SoundSport Its for working out. They stayed in my ears, but were uncomfortable, looked crazy, and I didn't like the stupid wire connect them. I would get sweaty and it would stick to the back of my neck and just make me feel ... gross. So, I purchased the Jabra Elite 8 Actives because virtually everyone said they stayed put no matter how strenuous the workout was. And I am so happy to report that they absolutely do stay in my ears. I do have different size tips, one is medium and the other small, but that is really more for comfort. Really, they stayed in no matter which size tip I attached. For me, that was the most important thing, and they did not disappoint.However, I know other people may expect more out of them than just that they stay put. So, let me address a few things you might be interested in. First, the ANC is good, and if I hadn't had the AirPods Pro for a week before I got these, I'm sure I would have said it was top notch! But Apple really has done an incredible job with that H2 chip and ANC. The thing is, though, that I have a set of Bose over-ear QuietComfort IIs, that I wear on airplanes and such. Point being, that no earbuds are ever going to be able to touch those. And for daily wear, riding on a bus, or walking down the street, the AirPods were better, but not so much so that it was a deal breaker. Along similar lines, the HearThrough feature was definitely good, but once again Apple had the edge with its Conversation Awareness. However, I actually ended up turning that feature off when wearing the AirPods because I am a bit of a singer (I don't mean I'm good, I'm horrible, but that doesn't stop me from belting out the lyrics along with the artist). The singing would cause C.A. to kick in and the volume would drastic lower and outside noise would be let in. I know it may not so like much, but it is bad enough that the artists get the lyrics wrong every now and again when I am signing, to have C.A. wrecking it further was just too much. Transparency mode was very similar to HearThrough, both of them allowed enough of the outside world in that you feel safe running with it on, you don't have to run with just a single bud in (though both the Jabras and the AirPods support it).In terms of music quality, they are both very very good. I am not an audiophile so I can't tell you about the lows and the highs (well, I could, but I would just be making something up). So, when I say they were both very very good, I mean that sitting on a bus with ANC on and my music turned up, made me feel like I could have been at a venue somewhere with the artist on stage. But, for around $200, they both should sound pretty darn good, so it is no surprise that they do.Finally, if you are like me and virtually all your electronics are from Apple, then the AirPods are wonderful in terms of bouncing from device to device depending on what is happening. For instance, I could be surfing the net and watching a YouTube video on my MBP with the AirPods connecting to the computer. Well, if a got a phone call, and answered it, the sound would automatically jump from the MBP to the iPhone. And again when I was done with the phone call, it would jump back to the videos. This is a really cool nice feature that you definitely miss out on with the Jabras.With all that said, I know it seems like the AirPods beat out the Jabras in virtually every way. But there are a few things to keep in mind. First, the Jabras had better battery life than the AirPods. And that is important to someone like me, who spends almost all day at a computer screen with earbuds in. Second, while Apple did win, the differences weren't so incredible that I felt like I was dealing with an inferior product when I put the Jabras in. The only time it was noticeable was when I was trying to compare them and was going back and forth to hear the difference. Both of them are extremely capable earbuds and I think anyone would be happy to receive either of them as a gift. Also, the Jabras are much more durable. You can actual submerge them in up to (I think) 5 feet of water. Bluetooth won't work under water, so you can't swim with them, but they would survive a couple laps in the pool if you were so inclined.The last thing I would like to talk about is the touch controls. I never liked the touch controls on the AirPods, and the new volume by rubbing up on the little stalk was no exception. I found it didn't work all that well, and was just as likely to accidentally pause the song as I was to actually raise or lower the volume (which is what I was attempting to do). In truth, It was such a problem for me that after the second day I would just ask Siri to raise or lower the volume by 15% (or whatever). So, I much preferred the solid feeling ""buttons"" on the Jabari's, and I actually used those controls. Though, I had gotten used to using Siri to mess with the volume that I carried that over to the Jabras. Especially since it is much quicker to say, 'Sire, raise the volume by 10%"" than it was to remember which side I was supposed to touch for raising the volume. To say nothing of actually holding the button down for a full second to start the volume change.In the end, I needed my earbuds to be able to. stay with me while I wailed on my pecks, and the AirPods just weren't up for the challenge. So, as much as I love Apple products, I returned the AirPods and kept the Jabras. This was made easier by the fact that I still had a pair of AirPods Pros 1st Gens. Sure the ANC is not as good, nor is the battery life. However, they are able to switch quickly from MacBook to iPad to iPhone and back again. That ability was the only feature that I felt I would really miss out on if I gave up the Pods. And with the 1st Gens able to do it, there was no contest. The AirPods went back to Best Buy, while the Jabras stayed in my ears.Oh, speaking of that, also I did want to mention that I found the Jabras to be incredibly comfortable. I often wear them all day, and I barely notice they are there. With the AirPods, since they don't stay in my ears, it was a constant struggle. And since I wanted them to stay in, I would sometimes push them in too far, or twist them around in weird ways with the result being ears that felt abused. And still the AirPods would fall out.",https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-Active-Comfortable-Cancellation/product-reviews/B0CB92Z7V2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1

They sound fantastic and though I can say some of the other brands sound a little bit better but all have really annoying controls that are hard to master.  The Jabras do one thing that the other never do and that is definite feedback when you select a function.  They use a physical button on each side that is covered by a waterproof silicone that gives you a clear detent when  it is pressed.  So you aren't ever trying to figure out where to press or pressing by mistake while looking for that ""sweet spot"" on a touch sensor.  In addition... you can actually turn these off without putting them in the case.  Just a short press on each and they sound a tone and turn completely off if you want to save the battery.  Turning them on is just as easy.  All other functions are clear and intuitive.  You can also configure different presses to do different things if you want.  I exercise in these often in a very hot climate and no issues with sweat.  I even shower with them and no problems at all.  I've used these for several months now and I consider them the best I've ever hand for for active earbuds.  You may have better results if you are just going to wear them around the house but if you are like me, frustrated by touch controls, I think you'll love these Jabras.",https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-Active-Comfortable-Cancellation/product-reviews/B0CB92Z7V2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1

I love their products. I've owned no less than six Jabra products since 2018. They've forced me off of the workout buds for years, due to them going away from wings (the Jabra sport was the best bluetooth gym headphones of all time - RIP) and the promise of earbuds staying put with better coatings has typically eluded the reality of my experience.  These are the closest to having an ear wing or over ear hook. Whatever is about the shape of my ear canals, all headphones eventually get pushed out - worse with my left ear, but honestly it's both. I tend to only go with workout buds that have one of the above options. However, after a horrific experience with the 4's, I decided to try these. The verdict is that the Jabra 8 is almost great, but it still could use a wing. They stay in my ears better than any non-winged earbuds ever have, but they have two problems. 1) Not enough tip sizes. If you're going to force me into this style, at least give me multiple tips. My ears are tweeners. The large is a touch too big and the mediums let just enough sweat in on a really hard workout to push the buds out. 2) No fast forward!The sound is excellent. It can sometimes feel like you're listening to music/podcasts in a room full of pillows rather than a stadium but that's cool. The noise cancelling is not perfect but cuts out 3/4's of the noise in most environments. I still haven't totally mastered the headset controls. Maybe they're inconsistent, or my taps are but I don't always get the desired result when I double-triple-long tap to access a function I'm looking for.They're wearable for hours, with little to no discomfort. Certainly a well made device that fits well with an active lifestyle. I'm always in earbuds, and these serve multiple purposes for me. So, the versatility is great.If you happen to get them wet, then wait until they're fully dry to make a call. Something gets into the microphones and people can't hear you. If you're in a noisy environment, you'll be heard but so will your background. So, if you work in a busy office or outside then you may need a different option to reduce the noise.Overall, as Jabra is known for, a great set of earbuds, but come on Jabra...hook a brotha' up with some ear wings!",https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-Active-Comfortable-Cancellation/product-reviews/B0CB92Z7V2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1

I have the 75t and purchased the Elite 8 active with the intention of using it for swimming laps. The website advertises it as water proof. I tested it today, and by the second lap I started getting a high pitched squealing in the right ear phones, even though I had my swim cap covering them completely.

My 75T headphones had stopped working. This was the third time the 75T headphones had stopped working over the course of the past three years. Most users would know that the 75T has these issues and often times it to find a replacement bud post warranty.I had to buy it soon rather than wait for this product to be out as my marathon was coming up in a week.  This is an early review as it has only been several weeks.  I also purchased it before the $20 price drop.I have used products from different companies, but prefer the in the ear styling without any ear hooks or adapters. I also like the strong bass sound and quality that these headphones provide.Pros1.  Secure fit in ear, smaller than the 75t but the elite 8 felt more secure than the 75t.  I2.  Prefer the Elite 8 design, and the clicking button is invisible.3.  Great sound for in the ear buds.  Base sounds great as expected.  I feel the quality of sound is better.4.  ANC (noise cancellation) works much better.  It worked great during airplane ride.  In the 75t I could not tell the difference between off and ANC but can tell with the Elite 8.5.  Durable:  I ran a whole marathon (just over three hours) and had no issues.  I threw water over myself and headphones had sweat and water and still worked well unlike the 75t that would cut out with water splash.6. Spatial audio is unique and probably more a personal thing and so won’t review that.Cons1.  Hear through:  every time I used it during a run it would go into off mode after a few minutes.  I would have to take a bud out of my ear and reinsert it for it to reset.  It could be a software issue.  It has less static than the 75t.  There were no issues when just sitting or light activities but that’s not why you get “active” model.2.  Off mode better for running.  ANC was actually noisier like wind noise and off mode made it better.  Hear through wasn’t working well during runs, so that may be significant issue.  I saw another review mentioning this and hope it can be resolved.Overall I enjoy the design and fit of the Jabra.  I was happy that sweat and water during a marathon did not affect the sound.  It stayed secure during a 3 hour run.I am looking forward to see how the durability is because the 75t was horrible.  The sound and fit is why it was worth the hassle.  It is an upgrade but I assume most 75t will switch when their headsets fail.  The four stars are more for the price and hear through issues when running.",https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-Active-Comfortable-Cancellation/product-reviews/B0CB92Z7V2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1
Unknown,R19ISLN1EC023E,Positive,"Jabra Elite 8 Active - Best, Most Advanced HearThrough Sports Wireless Bluetooth Earbuds - Comfortable Secure Fit, Military Grade Durability, Active Noise Cancellation, Dolby Surround Sound - Navy",4,4.0,304,"I generally thought the size of the overall buds was okay, though a bit on the large size. They stayed in my ears pretty well but feel the tips could be better designed because, unusually for me, I required the largest tips to get even halfway decent ANC but then the buds weren't completely stable in my ears. Using the smallest tips, I couldn't dislodge the earbuds no matter how much I crazily shook my head, jumped around etc. The medium tips seemed similar--even though didn't feel as stable, they stayed in. The large tips allowed the buds to fall out without even doing anything too goofy. However, ANC with the small and medium tips was lousy and only slightly better with the large tips.I liked the sound quality of these earbuds a lot, at least when in a quieter environment where I could enjoy it without ANC. I also think the battery life is very good--I wouldn't mind the buds having slightly longer battery life so they'd last for an entire cross-Atlantic flight--but that isn't a deal breaker. My main use would be at the gym or when running or working outside, so top priorities are good ANC, durability and decent sound. These certainly have the durability but being unable to get a good enough seal from the tips for good ANC, therefore unable to get good sound quality at the gym, is a deal breaker (I don't expect fantastic sound quality at the gym but good enough to hear music well and enjoy it). I would probably have been comfortable keeping these earbuds if they had fins for stabilizing them in your ear but, as they are now, I had to return them--the issue with falling out using the large tips, along with poor ANC unless wearing those tips is too much plus, when compared to other earbuds that fit well, the other earbuds had slightly better ANC. Obviously, my problems are mostly due to the shape of my ears and I would recommend these otherwise.",https://www.amazon.com/Jabra-Elite-Active-Comfortable-Cancellation/product-reviews/B0CB92Z7V2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1

Unknown,R17ZSVANE5AXT9,Positive,"ORICO Extension Cord, Flat Extension Cord with 8 Outlets 3 USB Ports (1 USB C), Ultra Thin Flat Plug, Wall Mount, White Extension Cord 15 feet with Multiple Outlets for Home Office, Dorm, White(15FT)",4.7,4.0,119,"This review is for the ""10 ft Extension Cord, ORICO Flat Extension Cord with 8 Outlets 3 USB Ports (1 USB C), Ultra Thin Flat Plug, Wall Mount, Long Extension Cord with Multiple outlets for Home, Office, Dorm Room, White"" that I received via the Vine program.This is an okay quality extension core with multiple things going for it. It has a nice long flat cord terminated with a flat 45-degree plug. This makes it perfect for plugging in behind furniture or anywhere access to the plug is minimal while still having a long enough extension to get the business end out in the open. The plugs are arranged so that USB and other power blocks can be easily supported without running together. The USB plugs are a nice addition as well these days.There are a few design choices that keep this from being a 5-star device. These days, devices are becoming more and more power hungry, and the USB ports are not particularly powerful, nor do they support any of the usual fast charging capabilities. They'll do fine for low power devices or times when charging speed isn't a priority.The power plugs are nicely spaced apart from each other, but to get full use of the device, cords and plugs will come out of all but the one end of the device. This means that there is no way to neatly route cables from the plugs to their associated devices and the device with cords will take up quite a bit of space. A better design choice, in my opinion, would have been to extend the device and put two more plugs on top and forego the side plugs.Even with the above issues, this is still a solid device for desktop or around the house extension cord duties and I have the perfect place for it, so it will be put to good use.",https://www.amazon.com/ORICO-Extension-Outlets-Multiple-Office/product-reviews/B0CW96SBD6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1
Unknown,RKFLZ07NPY63A,Positive,"ORICO Extension Cord, Flat Extension Cord with 8 Outlets 3 USB Ports (1 USB C), Ultra Thin Flat Plug, Wall Mount, White Extension Cord 15 feet with Multiple Outlets for Home Office, Dorm, White(15FT)",4.7,4.0,119,"This power strip has a very flexible cord with seemingly no memory.  I love that!  The plug is very close to the wall so it would be great for any tight outlet or where you have some furniture right in front of it.  The spacing of the 2 slot outlets on the sides is very useful for all those power bricks that you inevitably have.  In my case, I wasn't able to use any of the built in USB outlets as all the things I have in my media center that use them are switched and this strip wound up being before the switched one.  I took a before and after picture and although both seem like a cluster, you'll have to trust me that it's way better now with this strip.  I can at least get in there without having to untangle spaghetti mess of wires.Only issue I had with it was that they only supply 1"" mounting screws which are too long to use in most cabinet scenarios (don't want the screw going all the way through the panel).  That is a bigger problem than you would expect because the slots on the back of the power strip are so shallow that no common screw has a head thin enough to let the strip slide onto the screw.  I have a huge pile of hardware and it was really challenging to find shorter screws that would work.  They really should supply these with the strip and for that I'm deducting 1 star from the rating.  If you are not planning on mounting it, it's a 5 star product.  They do provide a sticker for mounting template, which was really nice.",https://www.amazon.com/ORICO-Extension-Outlets-Multiple-Office/product-reviews/B0CW96SBD6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1

Fitness and Sleep Trackers, Crash Detection, Heart Rate Monitor, Retina Display",4.3,4.0,214,"Didn’t realize this watch is not able to setup cell service. Meaning no data plan. Meaning you always have to have your phone with you. Which is fine I guess because it will save me $20/month. Otherwise, I really love this watch. I used to be a loyal Fitbit customer. But my 3rd one stopped working and the app has less and less features every year. But I digress. The iWatch has helped me start caring about exercise and my steps again. And it seamlessly works with your iPhone. It’s so nice being able to take calls and see notifications. Watch is great just a little disappointed about the cell service situation because I would have liked to go on walks without my phone. But it’s a good value so it’s worth the sacrifice.",https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Smartwatch-Starlight-Aluminium-Detection/product-reviews/B0DGJ73CFS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1

Fitness and Sleep Trackers, Crash Detection, Heart Rate Monitor, Retina Display",4.3,5.0,214,First off I would recommend this watch. Kind of wish I would have gone with a bigger face.Glad it is not any smaller than it is.Set up was super easy. Just make sure that you have upgraded to iOS 18.0.1.I suspect that you will like what they have done to the phone with this update.I am sure that I have yet to figure every thing out.I also recommend getting a protective case for it also as I have read that the face scratches easily.I like that there are numerous watch faces to choose from.When this watch runs out of juice I will be looking for the next SE watch that is available for purchase.,https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Smartwatch-Starlight-Aluminium-Detection/product-reviews/B0DGJ73CFS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1

Fitness and Sleep Trackers, Crash Detection, Heart Rate Monitor, Retina Display",4.3,5.0,214,"I had a second generation Apple Watch (for 8 years) and it fell and broke beyond repair. Since I was not willing to pay what an actual Apple Watch costs these days, my son found this one for me and it is brand new.I paired it with my IPhone and it has even more features than the one I previously owned. I am extremely happy and satisfied with it. Highly recommended for those who want an Apple Watch but don’t want to spend as much.( Bought new bands and case for protection)",https://www.amazon.com/Apple-Smartwatch-Starlight-Aluminium-Detection/product-reviews/B0DGJ73CFS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_viewopt_sr?ie=UTF8&reviewerType=all_reviews&filterByStar=positive&pageNumber=1
